<h2>I</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Widow</span>.</h3>


<div class='cap'>"WHAT would you say,"
asked the widow,
tucking her skirts
cautiously about her
patent leather toes and leaning back
luxuriously against the variegated
pillows, "if I should tell you that I
have found the very girl who would
make you a model wife?"</div>

<p>The bachelor glanced up indifferently
and dipped the paddle lazily
into the water.</p>

<p>"What model?" he asked, suspiciously.
"Women are like automobiles,
you know. There are so
many models. And even after you
have selected one most carefully you
never can tell what it is going to do."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"They are more like horses," declared
the widow, "if you know how
to handle them, and are gentle and
kind&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And let them see you're master&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And don't jab them with spiteful
little spurs&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And know when to pull on the
curb&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And when to coax them with
sugar&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And when to beat 'em&mdash;and even
then you can't tell what they're going
to shy at or balk at any more than
you can tell when an automobile is
going to break down or run away or
blow up. But this 'model'&mdash;is she
pretty and fetching and warranted to
run smoothly over rough roads and
to climb all the matrimonial hills<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and not puncture a tire in the finances
and to be just as good for a long run
as for a spurt? Is she smart looking
and substantial and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The widow sat up so quickly that
the canoe swayed unsteadily beneath
them.</p>

<p>"She's not a harem, Mr. Travers!"
she cried. "Oh, dear!" she sighed
hopelessly, leaning back again, "why
is it that every man expects to get a
harem of virtues combined in one
wife? I don't believe any man but
Solomon was ever perfectly satisfied
with domestic life."</p>

<p>"Solomon," remarked the bachelor,
giving the paddle an emphatic
shove, "understood the necessity for
variety in wives. But if Solomon
had lived in the twentieth century
he wouldn't have needed so many&mdash;er&mdash;annexations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
He would have
got it all in one modern woman.
Now, you, for instance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Speaking impersonally," interrupted
the widow, trying to look
austere and at the same time to blow
a chiffon veil out of her mouth,
"when a man buys an automobile he
selects a runabout or a victoria or a
touring car or a racing machine,
according to his needs, and is satisfied."</p>

<p>"Not at all," protested the bachelor.
"The moment he has one automobile
he is sighing for another, and
he is never happy until he has a garage
full&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And it is the same about a coat or
a hat," persisted the widow, ignoring
the interruption; "he picks out what
suits him best; but he doesn't expect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
his top hat to do him for picnics nor
his swallow-tail to serve for lawn
tennis nor his yachting cap to look
well in church nor&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A derby," interrupted the bachelor,
"will do almost anywhere."</p>

<p>"They're hideous, Mr. Travers!
and stiff and commonplace and uncomfortable
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are they anything like the model
wife you've picked out for me?" inquired
the bachelor insinuatingly.</p>

<p>The widow flushed under the corner
of her chiffon veil.</p>

<p>"Well," she acquiesced unwillingly,
"she isn't particularly pretty
nor brilliant and fascinating, and all
that; but she's just the kind of a girl
a man ought to marry."</p>

<p>"And never does!" finished the
bachelor triumphantly, backing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
water and turning the canoe for mid-stream.
"Of all kinds of women a
man detests&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How many kinds of women are
there?" cried the widow suddenly.</p>

<p>"How many women are there?"
retorted the bachelor. "The variety
is only limited by the number of
feminine individuals. But fundamentally
they can be divided into
two classes, just as automobiles can
be divided into gasoline and electric.
There is the woman a man wants to
marry, the kind that is stamped from
birth for wifehood, the even-tempered,
steady-going, comfortable
kind of girl that you would like to
tie to for life and with whom you
know you would be perfectly contented&mdash;and
utterly stupid. Every
man has in mind his ideal wife; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
nearly every man's ideal is of the
calm, domestic, wholly good, wholly
sweet sort, the sort that seems like a
harbor away from the storm. But so
often, just about as he has found this
ideal, or before he has found her and
before the sun of his summer day
dream has risen the storm comes
along&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"The tumultuous, impossible, adorable,
unfathomable woman&mdash;the
woman who may be good or bad,
ugly or beautiful, but is always fascinating,
alluring and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'irresistable'">irresistible</ins>.
And she wrecks his little summer day
dream and turns his snug harbor into
a roaring whirlpool and carries him
off in a tempest. Sometimes he marries
her and sometimes he doesn't;
but whether he does or does not, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
is always spoiled for the other kind
afterward."</p>

<p>"And if he does marry her," added
the widow, trailing her fingers
thoughtfully in the water, "he is
always sorry and wishing he had
married the other kind."</p>

<p>"Well," the bachelor laid his
paddle across his knee, "what's the
difference? If he had married the
other kind he would always have
been wishing he hadn't. Now if a
man could only be allowed two
wives&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One for week days and one for&mdash;holidays?"
inquired the widow sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Yes," acquiesced the bachelor,
"one for each side of him, the tame
side and the untamed side. One to
serve as a harbor and make him a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
home and fulfill his domestic longings
and bring up his children and
keep him sane and moral; and the
other to amuse him and entertain him
and inspire him and put the trimmings
on life and the spice and flavor
in the matrimonial dish."</p>

<p>"A sedative and a stimulant!"
jeered the widow. "One to stir you
up and one to calm you down; one
to spur you forward and one to pull
on the curb&mdash;a Hebe and a Minerva!
And then you'd be running around
demanding a Venus to make you forget
the other two. Whatever woman
a man marries, he invariably spends
his life sighing for something different.
If he is tied to a nice, soft sofa
pillow, he longs for a backbone. If
he marries a parlor ornament, he
yearns for a kitchen utensil. If his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
wife has a Greek nose, he discovers
afterward that what he really admires
is pugs. If he picks out red
hair or black, he will go blocks out
of his way to pursue every yellow
glint that catches his eye. And if he
married a whole harem at once he
would discover that what he really
wanted was monogamy, and a single
wife with a single idea. There aren't
enough kinds of women in the world
to fulfill any one man's idea of what
a wife should be."</p>

<p>"And yet," sighed the bachelor, "I
once knew a woman who would have
done that&mdash;all by herself."</p>

<p>The widow looked unconvinced.</p>

<p>"Was she a model wife?" she inquired,
skeptically.</p>

<p>"How do I know?" said the bachelor.
"She wasn't my wife."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course not!" cried the widow.
"It is always the other man's wife
who is our ideal&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She wasn't my ideal," protested
the bachelor. "She was the storm
that shattered my ideal and spoiled
me for matrimony. She was a whole
garage, a whole stable, a whole
harem in one."</p>

<p>The widow looked distinctly disapproving.</p>

<p>"It's lucky," she said coldly, "that
you escaped&mdash;a woman like&mdash;that!"</p>

<p>"But I haven't," protested the
bachelor, laying down his paddle and
leaning forward so that the ends of
the widow's chiffon veil blew in his
face. "She was the spice in life's
pudding, the flavor, the sauce, the
stimulant, the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This canoe is tipping dreadfully,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
remarked the widow, but the disapproval
had disappeared from her
eyes.</p>

<p>"She was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, I do believe it's growing
dark, Mr. Travers."</p>

<p>"It is," agreed the bachelor. "Nobody
can see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"See&mdash;what?" asked the widow,
suddenly sitting up straight and fixing
the bachelor with her eyes.</p>

<p>"How perfectly adorable and unfathomable
and tumultuous&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you feeding me sugar, Mr.
Travers?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," acknowledged the
bachelor, leaning back and picking
up the paddle again, "but some day,
when I'm ready, I'm going to stop
feeding you sugar. I'm going to put
on the curb bit."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why don't you do it now&mdash;Billy?"
asked the widow, with a challenging
glance from beneath her
lashes.</p>

<p>"I can't," grumbled the bachelor,
"while you are blowing that chiffon
veil."</p>

<p>The widow took the two ends of
the offensive thing and tied them deliberately
under her chin.</p>

<p>"Some day," continued the bachelor,
as he swung the canoe shoreward
with a vigorous dip of the paddle,
"I'm going to show you who's master.
I'm going to marry you and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be sorry!" laughed the widow.</p>

<p>"Of course," assented the bachelor,
"but I'd be sorrier&mdash;if I didn't."</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Winning Card?</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>"THERE," said the bachelor
as he bowed to a little
man across the room,
"sits the eighth wonder
of the world&mdash;a man with a squint
and a cork leg and no income to speak
of, who has just married for the third
time. What makes us so fascinating?"</div>

<p>The widow laid down her oyster
fork and gazed thoughtfully at the
beautiful girl in blue chiffon sitting
opposite the man with the squint.</p>

<p>"Don't generalize," she said, turning
rebukingly to the bachelor. "You
mean what makes the little man so
fascinating?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>The bachelor jabbed an oyster
viciously.</p>

<p>"Well," he grumbled, "what does
make him so fascinating? Is it the
squint or the cork&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The widow looked at him reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Don't be envious," she said. "He
might have two squints and yet be
successful with women. Haven't you
ever seen a runty, plain little man before,
with nothing on earth, apparently,
to recommend him except his
sex, who could draw the women as a
magnet does needles?"</p>

<p>The bachelor dropped his oyster
and stared at the widow.</p>

<p>"It's hypnotism!" he declared with
solemn conviction.</p>

<p>The widow laughed.</p>

<p>"It's nothing of the sort," she contradicted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
"It's because he holds
man's winning card and knows how
to play it. Just observe the tender
solicitude with which he consults her
about that fish."</p>

<p>"You mean," inquired the bachelor
suspiciously, "that he has a fascinating
way?"</p>

<p>"That's all he needs," responded
the widow promptly, "to make him
irresistible."</p>

<p>"Then, how do you account,"
argued the bachelor, indicating a
Gibsonesque young man eating his
dinner alone under a palm at the corner
table, "for the popularity of
that Greek god over there? He's a
perfect boor, yet the women in this
hotel pet him and coax him and
cuddle him as if he were a prize lion
cub."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh," remarked the widow, "if
you were all Greek gods&mdash;that would
be different. But, unfortunately, the
average man is just an ungainly looking
thing in a derby hat and hideous
clothes, with knuckly hands and
padded shoulders and a rough chin."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the bachelor
sweetly. "I see&mdash;as in a looking
glass. Evidently our countenances&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pooh!" jeered the widow, "your
countenances just don't count. That's
all. What profiteth it a man though
he have the face of an <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Appollo'">Apollo</ins> if he
have the legs of a Caliban? A woman
never bothers about a man's face. It's
his figure that attracts her. She will
forgive weak eyes and a cut-off chin
twice as quickly as weak shoulders
and cut-off legs."</p>

<p>"That's why we pad them&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
shoulders," explained the bachelor.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't need to," retorted
the widow, "if you knew how to play
the winning card."</p>

<p>"What IS the winning card?" implored
the bachelor, leaning across
the table anxiously.</p>

<p>The widow laid down her soup
spoon and bent to arrange the violets
in her belt meditatively.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "Sir Walter Raleigh
played it and it won him a title;
and Mr. Mantellini played it and it
kept him in spending money and
fancy waistcoats for years without his
doing a stroke of work; and Louis
XIV.&mdash;but oh, pshaw! You know
all about that. Briefly speaking, a
man's winning card is his knowledge
of how to treat a woman. Specifically,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
it is a tender, solicitous, protecting
manner. A woman just loves to
be 'protected,' whether there is anything
to be protected from or not.
She loves to know that you are anxious
for her safety and comfort, even
when there is no cause in the world
for your anxiety. She loves to have
you wait on her, even when there is
a room full of hired waiters about.
She loves to be treated like an adorable,
cunning, helpless child, even
when she is five feet ten and weighs
a cool two hundred. She delights in
having a mental cloak laid down for
her to walk over and every time you
do it she secretly knights you."</p>

<p>"It sounds awfully easy," said the
bachelor.</p>

<p>"But it isn't," retorted the widow,
"if it were all men would try it&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
all men would be perfectly irresistible."</p>

<p>"Well, aren't they?" asked the
bachelor, innocently. "I thought
they&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The winning way, the irresistible
masculine manner," pursued the
widow, ignoring the interruption, "is
something subtle and inborn. It can't
be put on or varnished over. It is
neither a pose nor a patent. It is the
gift of one of the good fairies at birth.
If it is going to be trained into a man
he must be caught and schooled very
early&mdash;say, before he is ten years
old. It's his ingrain attitude toward
women and he begins by practicing
it on his mother. If he is not to the
manner born and tries to cultivate it
late in life, he must watch very carefully
to see that he does not overdo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
it like a lackey or a dancing master or
the villain in a melodrama. Of
course, it can be cultivated to a certain
extent, like music or Christian
Science, but it's hard for a man to
learn that a woman is a fragile creature
and needs a bodyguard, after
he has been twenty years letting his
sisters pack their own trunks and lug
their own satchels and golf clubs.
Besides, most men are too busy or too
self-absorbed to cultivate it, if they
could."</p>

<p>"Most men," remarked the bachelor,
stirring his coffee and lighting
his cigarette, "aren't anxious to become
the sort of 'mother's darling'
you describe."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," retorted the widow.
"Richard the Third was a perfectly
adorable ladies' man and he couldn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
be called exactly&mdash;a 'mother's darling.'
Yet the things he said to poor
Lady Anne and the way he said them
would have turned any feminine
brain. It isn't milk and water that
women admire; it's the milk of
human interest. It's the feeling that
a man is gazing at you instead of
through you at his own reflection&mdash;or
some other woman."</p>

<p>"But if it means giving up all the
easy chairs," protested the bachelor,
"and packing all the family trunks
and putting out your pipe every time
a female member of the family approaches
and eating dishes you don't
want and running round doing household
errands, a man hasn't got
time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It doesn't!" declared the widow.
"It has nothing to do with morals or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
with selfishness. Some of the most
selfish men in the world are those
whom a poor little woman will work
her fingers to the bone to support,
simply because when she comes home
at night after her labors her husband
puts his arms around her and tells
her how sad it makes him feel to see
her struggle so, and how young and
beautiful she keeps in spite of it all
and orders her to lie down and let
him run out and fetch her some ice cream
and read to her. A man with
that sort of way with him can get anything
on earth out of a woman and
then make her eternally grateful to
him. Look at the husbands who slave
all day earning money for their wives
to spend and go home tired out and
grouchy and never get a word of
thanks. Yet, a man can stay out six<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
nights in the week, and if he will
come home on the seventh with a kiss
and a compliment and a box of candy
and any old lie and a speech about
sympathy and all that, a nice sensible
wife will forgive and forget&mdash;and
adore him."</p>

</div>

<p>"But are there any nice sensible
wives?" asked the bachelor plaintively.</p>

<p>"Have you finished your cigarette,
Mr. Travers?" inquired the widow
coolly.</p>

<p>"Because if there are, that is just
what I am looking&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you have," pursued the widow,
"I think we had better go."</p>

<p>The bachelor rose with alacrity.
"I think so, too," he acquiesced,
pleasantly. "That Greek god over
yonder under the palm has been staring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
at me as if he contemplated murder
for the last half hour."</p>

<p>The widow blushed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she said with a one-cornered
smile, "he is envying you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly!" agreed the bachelor.</p>

<p>"Envying you," pursued the
widow, "your fascinating ways."</p>

<p>"Oh," cried the bachelor, "then I
have got it."</p>

<p>"What?" said the widow.</p>

<p>"The winning card. The charm!"</p>

<p>"Well," said the widow, putting
her head on the side and gazing at
him speculatively, "you wear a derby
hat."</p>

<p>"I take it off in the house and in
the presence of ladies," protested the
bachelor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"And your shoulders&mdash;&mdash;" began
the widow.</p>

<p>"They are my own!" declared the
bachelor.</p>

<p>"And your&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They also are mine," broke in the
bachelor quickly.</p>

<p>"And besides all that," added the
widow, "you have that little bald spot
in the middle of your head. And
yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on," said the bachelor, "you
have said the worst."</p>

<p>"I broke an engagement with a
nice boy to dine with you to-night."</p>

<p>"That doesn't prove anything,"
said the bachelor scornfully. "Maybe
he hasn't played the winning
card."</p>

<p>"No, it proves you have," declared
the widow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't see it!" protested the
bachelor.</p>

<p>"Well, just look at the Greek god
over under the palm and then look
in the glass at yourself and&mdash;work
it out."</p>

<p>"But why look at the Greek god?"</p>

<p>"Because," said the widow, turning
to the mirror and carefully tilting her
hat, "he is the nice boy with whom
I broke the engagement."</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Why</span>?</h3>


<div class='cap'>"WHY is a woman?"
snapped the bachelor,
flinging himself into
the big armchair opposite
the widow with a challenging
glance.</div>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, because," stammered
the widow; startled at his sudden appearance.</p>

<p>"I knew it!" said the bachelor with
conviction.</p>

<p>"And there are lots of other
reasons, Mr. Travers."</p>

<p>"But they aren't reasonable," declared
the bachelor doggedly.</p>

<p>The widow closed her book with a
sigh and laid it on the table beside
her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who said they were?" she asked
witheringly. "Neither is a woman.
Being reasonable is so stupid. It's
worse than being suitable or sensible,
or&mdash;or proper."</p>

<p>The bachelor lifted his eyebrows
in mild astonishment.</p>

<p>"I thought those were virtues," he
protested.</p>

<p>"They are, Mr. Travers," returned
the widow crushingly, "and that's
why they're so uninteresting. You
might as well ask why is music, or
painting, or p&acirc;t&eacute; de foie gras, or
champagne, or ice cream, or anything
else charming and delicious&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And utterly useless."</p>

<p>"Of course," agreed the widow,
leaning back and thoughtfully twisting
the bit of lace she called a handkerchief.
"It's the utterly useless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
things that make the world attractive
and pleasant to live in&mdash;like flowers
and bonbons and politics and love&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And tobacco," added the bachelor
reflectively.</p>

<p>"Woman is the dessert to the
feast," went on the widow, "the
trimmings on the garment of life, the
spice in the pudding. Of course, a
man can eat his dinner without dessert
or champagne and live his life
without kisses or a woman&mdash;but
somehow he never does."</p>

<p>"And that's just where he gets into
trouble," retorted the bachelor
promptly. "If you could only tell,"
he went on pathetically, "what any
one of them was going to do or why
she was going to do it, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then it isn't 'Why <i>is</i> a woman?'
but 'Why <i>does</i> a woman?' that you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
wanted to know," interrupted the
widow helpfully.</p>

<p>"That's it!" cried the bachelor,
"why does she get off a car backward?
Why does she wear a skirt
four yards long and then get furious
if you step on it? Why does she
make a solemn and important engagement
without the slightest intention
of keeping it? Why does she
put on open-work stockings and
gaudy shoes and hold her frock as
high as she dares&mdash;and then annihilate
you if you stare at her? Why
does she use everything as it was not
intended to be used&mdash;a hairpin to
pick a lock, a buttonhook to open a
can, a hairbrush to hammer a nail, a
hatpin to rob a letter box, a razor to
sharpen a pencil and a cup and saucer
to decorate the mantelpiece? Why<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
does she gush over the woman she
hates worst and snub the man she is
dying to marry? Why does she lick
all the glue off a postage stamp and
then try to make it stick? Why does
she cry at a wedding and act frivolous
at a funeral? Why does she put
a new feather on her hat and a new
kink in her hair, and expect a man to
notice it as quickly and be as astonished
as he would if she had shaved
her head or lost a limb? Why does
she seem offended if you don't make
love to her, and then get angry if you
do? Why does she act kittenish when
she's big and dignified, when she's
little and old, when she's young and
silly, when she's old? And why, oh,
why, did you inveigle me into coming
down to this miserable pink-and-white
house party with the hope of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
being near you and then utterly ignore
me and spend your time flirting
with Bobby Taylor, while I sulk
about like a lost sheep or run
errands&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For Miss Manners?" suggested
the widow cuttingly.</p>

<p>"Miss Manners!" exclaimed the
bachelor scornfully.</p>

<p>"You once thought her very beautiful,
Mr. Travers."</p>

<p>"That's just it!" retorted the
bachelor. "Why didn't you let me
go on thinking her beautiful&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'As delicate as a sea shell,' wasn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," snapped the bachelor, "and
as&mdash;hollow!"</p>

<p>The widow smiled enigmatically.</p>

<p>"Tell me," she said sympathetically,
"what she has done to you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, for one thing," complained
the bachelor, "she coaxed me out on
the piazza last night in the moonlight,
and then, when she had talked
sentiment for half an hour and lured
me to a dark spot and simply goaded
me into taking her hand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The widow sat up straight.</p>

<p>"But you didn't do it, Billy Travers!"</p>

<p>"Of course I did. It seemed almost
an insult not to. And what did she
do? She jerked it away, flung herself
from me, rose like an outraged
queen, turned on me with that 'I-thought-you-were-a-gentleman'
air
and said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The widow lay back in her chair
and laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, mercy!" she said, wiping the
tears from her eyes when she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
able. "Excuse me but&mdash;but&mdash;how
did she look when she did it?"</p>

<p>"Well," confessed the bachelor,
"she did look rather stunning."</p>

<p>"That's why she did it," explained
the widow between laughs. "A
woman's reason for doing most things
is because she thinks she will look
well doing them."</p>

<p>"Or because she thinks you will
look surprised if she does them."</p>

<p>"Or because she wants to attract
your attention."</p>

<p>"Or to make you feel uncomfortable."</p>

<p>"Or to astonish you or amuse you
or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Work on your sensibilities, or get
on your nerves, or play on your
sympathies. But," he went on growing
wroth at the recollection, "the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
idea of a little chit like that&mdash;and
that isn't the worst. This morning
she dragged me out of bed at half-past
five to go fishing. Fishing! At
this season! I never saw a girl so
crazy for fish in my life; and when
we had walked four miles to find the
right spot and she had been silent
long enough for me to feel a nibble
at the bait and had helped me with
all her might and main to haul in that
blessed little fish, do you know what
she did?"</p>

<p>The widow looked up questioningly.</p>

<p>"She cried because I wanted to
bring it home and made me throw it
back into the water. That's what she
did!"</p>

<p>The widow sat up straight, with
horrified eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, of course she did!" she exclaimed
heatedly. "She only asked
you to <i>catch</i> the fish didn't she&mdash;not
to <i>kill</i> it?"</p>

<p>The bachelor stared at her for a
moment without speaking. Then he
got up silently and walked over to
the window.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he remarked after a
long pause, apparently addressing
the front lawn or the blue heavens,
"that it's that same sort of logic that
incites a woman to play for a man
until she catches him&mdash;and then
throw him overboard. O Lord," he
continued, glancing at the sky devoutly,
"why couldn't you have made
them nice and sensible?"</p>

<p>The widow took up her book with
disdain.</p>

<p>"'Nice and sensible'" she repeated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
witheringly. "Just think how it
would feel to be called 'nice and sensible!'
I wish," she added, turning to
her novel with an air of boredom,
"that you would go and&mdash;talk to
Ethel Manners."</p>

<p>The bachelor eyed her narrowly.</p>

<p>"I guess I will," he said finally.
"She seems more interesting&mdash;now
that you've explained her."</p>

<p>The widow stopped in the middle
of a paragraph and looked up.</p>

<p>"And by Jove!" went on the bachelor
reminiscently, turning to the
window again, "she did look dreamy
in a sunbonnet and that little short
skirt this morning. She has adorable
feet, you know."</p>

<p>The widow closed her book with
a sharp snap, keeping her fingers between
the pages.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>I</i> know, Mr. Travers; but how
did <i>you</i> know?"</p>

<p>"I looked at them," confessed the
bachelor frankly, "and her ankles&mdash;"</p>

<p>The widow's mouth closed in a
straight line.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid, Mr. Travers," she remarked
frigidly, "that you are not a
fit companion for a young girl like
Ethel."</p>

<p>"I'm not equal to her," grinned
the bachelor.</p>

<p>"No, you're not. She's a nice, sensible
girl and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you hate her very much?"</p>

<p>"Hate her?" The widow's eyes
opened with astonishment.</p>

<p>"You called her 'nice and sensible.'"</p>

<p>"Bobby Taylor's looking for you,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Marion," called Miss Manners,
glancing in at the door suddenly.</p>

<p>"Well, goodby. I'm off," said the
bachelor, following the swish of Miss
Manners's skirts with his eyes, as she
hurried away down the hall.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Mr. Travers!" commanded
the widow in an awful tone.</p>

<p>At that moment a buoyant young
man poked his head in at the door.</p>

<p>"Go way, Bobby," said the widow.
"Mr. Travers and I are discussing&mdash;er&mdash;psychology."</p>

<p>"Ugh!" remarked Bobby, dutifully
withdrawing, "why do you do it, if
it hurts?"</p>

<p>The bachelor looked up at the
widow under the tail of his eyelid.</p>

<p>"Does it hurt?" he asked.</p>

<p>But the widow's underlip was
curled into a distinct pout and her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
eyes met his reproachfully. She
dabbed them effectively with the end
of her lace handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Of c-course it does," she said
with a little choke in her voice,
"when you have been here three
whole days and have never noticed
me and have spent every minute of
your time trailing around after that&mdash;that&mdash;little&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But wasn't that what you invited
me for?" exclaimed the bachelor
helplessly.</p>

<p>"Of course it was," acknowledged
the widow, "but&mdash;but I didn't think
you'd do it."</p>

<p>The bachelor gazed at her a
moment in blank amazement. Then
a gleam of enlightenment came into
his eyes and he leaned over and
caught her fingers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look here, Marion," he said
gently, "you invited me down here
to fling that girl at my head. If you
didn't want me to fall in love with
her, what did you want?"</p>

<p>"I wanted you to get enough of
her!" explained the widow, smiling
through her lace handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I have. I've got too
much!" vowed the bachelor fervently.</p>

<p>The widow laughed softly and
complacently.</p>

<p>"That's just what I knew would
happen," she said, closing her novel
and flinging it onto the couch.</p>

<p>Then she added, looking up quizzically:</p>

<p>"A woman always has a reason&mdash;if
you can only find out what it is."</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Widow's Rival.</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>"WHY," said the widow,
gazing thoughtfully
at the ruby-faced
woman with the gigantic
waist-line, who sat beside
the meek little man on the bench
opposite, "do men marry&mdash;those?"</div>

<p>The bachelor glanced into the violet
eyes beneath the violet hat.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he said insinuatingly,
"because they can't get&mdash;somebody
else."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," replied the widow
poking her parasol emphatically into
the sand. "With all the chance a
man has&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Chance!" cried the bachelor
scoffingly. "Chance! What chance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
has a man got after a woman makes
up her mind to marry him?"</p>

<p>The widow dug the sand spitefully
with the point of her violet sunshade.</p>

<p>"I didn't refer to the chance of
escape," she replied, icily. "I was
speaking of the chance of a choice."</p>

<p>"That's it!" cried the bachelor.
"The selection is so great&mdash;the choice
is so varied! Don't you know how it
is when you have too many dress patterns
or hats or rings to choose from?
You find it difficult to settle on any
one&mdash;so difficult, in fact, that you decide
not to choose at all, but to keep
them all dangling&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or else just shut your eyes," interrupted
the widow, "and put out
your hand and grab something."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 370px;">
<img src="images/illus-3.jpg" width="370" height="500" alt="&quot;CHANCE! what chance has a man got?&quot; Page 48" title="" />
<div class='cap'><span class="caption">&quot;CHANCE! what chance has a man got?&quot;</span></div><br /> <div class='pagref'><i>Page 48</i></div>
</div>

<p>"Of course, you shut your eyes!"
acquiesced the bachelor. "Whoever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
went into matrimony with his eyes
open?"</p>

<p>"A woman does," declared the
widow tentatively. "She knows exactly
what she wants, and if it is
possible, she gets it. It is only after
she has tried and failed many times
that she puts her hand into the matrimonial
grab-bag, and accepts anything
she happens to pull out. But
a man never employs any reason at
all in picking out a wife&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Naturally!" scoffed the bachelor.
"By that time, he's lost his reason!"</p>

<p>The widow rested her elbow on
the handle of her sunshade, put her
chin in her hand and smiled out at
the sea.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "he has. He has
reached the marrying mood."</p>

<p>"The&mdash;what?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"The marrying mood. A man
never decides to marry a girl just
simply because he loves her, or because
she is suitable, or because he
ought to marry her, or because she
is irresistible or fascinating or in
love with him. He never marries at
all until he gets the marrying mood,
the matrimonial fever&mdash;and then he
marries the first girl who comes
along and wants him, young or old,
pretty or ugly, good or bad. And that
explains why a lot of men are tied
up to women that you cannot possibly
see any reason for having been married
at all, much less married to those
particular men."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" exclaimed the
bachelor, "I'm glad I've got past the
age&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you haven't!" declared the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
widow emphatically. "The marrying
fever is, like the measles or the
appendicitis, liable to catch you at
any age or stage, and you never know
when or why or how you got it.
Sometimes a man takes it when he is
very young and rushes into a fool
marriage with a woman twice his
age, and sometimes he goes all his
life up to sixty without catching the
contagion and then gets it horribly
and marries his cook or a chorus girl
young enough to be his granddaughter.
Haven't you seen confirmed
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'bachelor'">bachelors</ins> successfully resist the wiles
of the most fascinating women and
turn down a dozen suitable girls&mdash;and
then, just when you thought
they were quite safe and entirely past
the chance of marriage as well as
their first youth, turn around and tie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
themselves to some little fool thing
without a penny to her name or a
thought worth half that amount?
That was a late attack of the matrimonial
fever&mdash;and the older you get
it the harder it goes. Let me see,"
added the widow thoughtfully, "how
old are you?"</p>

<p>"I haven't lost my ideals&mdash;nor my
teeth!" declared the bachelor defensively.</p>

<p>"What is your ideal?" asked the
widow leaning over and peeping up
under the bachelor's hat brim.</p>

<p>The bachelor stared back at her
through lowered lashes.</p>

<p>"It's got on a violet hat," he began,
"and violet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is that a ship out there?" asked
the widow, suddenly becoming interested
in the sea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"And violet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" she interrupted petulantly.
"Of course, you've got ideals.
All men have ideals&mdash;but they don't
often marry them. The trouble is
that when a man has the marrying
fever he can clothe anything in curls
and petticoats with the illusions he
has built around that ideal, and put
the ideal's halo on her head and imagine
she is the real thing. He can
look at a red-headed, pug-nosed girl
from an angle that will make her
hair seem pure gold and her pug look
Greek. By some mental feat, he can
transform a girl six feet tall with no
waist line and an acute elbow into a
kittenish, plump little thing that he
has always had in mind&mdash;and marry
her. Or, if his ideal is tall and willowy
and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'etherial'">ethereal</ins>, and he happens to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
meet a woman weighing 200 pounds
whose first thought in the morning is
her breakfast and whole last thought
at night is her dinner, he will picture
her merely attractively plump and a
marvel of intellect and imagination.
And," the widow sank her chin in
her hand and gazed out to sea reflectively,
"it is all so pitiful, when you
think how happy men could make
marriage, if they would only go
about it scientifically!"</p>

<p>"Then what," inquired the bachelor
flinging away his cigar and folding
his arms dramatically, "is the
science of choosing a wife?"</p>

<p>"Well," said the widow, counting
off on the tips of her lilac silk gloves,
"first of all a man should never
choose a wife when he finds himself
feeling lonesome and dreaming of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
furnished flats and stopping to talk
to babies in the street. He has the
marrying fever then, and is in no fit
condition to pick out a wife and unless
he is very careful he is liable to
marry the first girl who smiles at him.
He should shut his eyes tight and flee
to the wilderness and not come back
until he is prepared to see women in
their proper lights and their right
proportions."</p>

<p>"And then?" suggested the bachelor.</p>

<p>"Then," announced the widow
oratorically, "he should choose a
wife as he would a dish at the table&mdash;not
because he finds her attractive
or delicious or spicy, but&mdash;because
he thinks she will agree with him."</p>

<p>"I see," added the bachelor, "and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
won't keep him awake nights," he
added.</p>

<p>The widow nodded.</p>

<p>"Nor give him a bitter taste in the
mouth in the morning. A good wife
is like a dose of medicine&mdash;hard to
swallow, but truly helpful. The girls
who wear frills and high heels and
curly pompadours are like the salad
with the most dressing and garnishing,
likely to be too rich and spicy,
while the plain little thing in the
serge skirt, who never powders her
nose, may prove as sweet and
wholesome&mdash;as&mdash;as home-made pudding."</p>

<p>"Or&mdash;home-made pickles," suggested
the bachelor with wry face.</p>

<p>The widow shook her parasol at
him admonishingly.</p>

<p>"Don't do that!" cried the bachelor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do what?" inquired the widow in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Wave your frills in my eyes! I
had just made up my mind to propose
to Miss Gunning and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The widow sat up perfectly
straight.</p>

<p>"Do you really admire&mdash;a marble
slab, Mr. Travers?"</p>

<p>"And your frills," pursued the
bachelor, unmoved, "like salad dressing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon."</p>

<p>"Or garnishings&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Travers!"</p>

<p>"Might be merely a lure to make
me take something which would disagree
with me."</p>

<p>The widow rose and looked coolly
out over the waves.</p>

<p>"I can't see," she said, "why you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
should fancy there could be any
chance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't," sighed the bachelor. "It
isn't a matter of chance, but of
choice."</p>

<p>The ice in the widow's eyes melted
into sun in a moment. She turned to
the bachelor impulsively.</p>

<p>"Why do you want to marry me?"
she asked.</p>

<p>The bachelor rose and looked
down at her critically.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "for one thing, because
you're just the woman I ought
not to marry."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"You're too highly spiced&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Billy!"</p>

<p>"And you'd be sure not to agree
with me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Billy Travers!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"And because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well? Go on."</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;&mdash;" The bachelor hesitated
and gazed deep into the violet
eyes.</p>

<p>"Please proceed, Mr. Travers."</p>

<p>"I won't!" The bachelor turned
his back on her defiantly.</p>

<p>The widow came a little nearer
and stooped around to peep under his
hat-brim.</p>

<p>"Please&mdash;Billy!" she breathed
softly.</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;because I'm in the
marrying mood," he replied.</p>

<p>But the widow was half way to the
hotel before he knew what had happened.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Money and Matrimony</span>.</h3>


<div class='cap'>"WHAT rhymes with
'matrimony'?" inquired
the widow,
taking her pencil out
of her mouth and looking up
thoughtfully through the fringes of
her pompadour.</div>

<p>"Money," responded the bachelor
promptly, as he flung himself down
on the grass beside her and proceeded
to study her profile through the
shadows of the maple leaves.</p>

<p>The widow tilted her chin scornfully.</p>

<p>"I suppose they do sound alike,"
she condescended, "but I am making
a poem; and there is no poetical harmony
in the combination."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is no harmony at all without
it," remarked the bachelor
shortly. "But how on earth can you
make a poem out of matrimony?"</p>

<p>"Some people do," replied the
widow loftily.</p>

<p>"On paper!" sneered the bachelor.
"On paper they make poems of death
and babies and railroad accidents and
health foods. But in real life matrimony
isn't a poem; it's more like a
declaration of war, or an itemized expense
account, or a census report, or
a cold business proposition."</p>

<p>The widow bit the end of her pencil
and laid aside her paper. If the
bachelor could have caught a glimpse
of her eyes beneath the lowered lashes
he might not have gone on; but he
was studying the sky through the
maple leaves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a beautiful business proposition,"
he added. "A magnificent
money making scheme, a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The bachelor's eyes had dropped
to the widow's and he stopped short.</p>

<p>"Go on," she remarked in a cold,
sweet voice that trickled down his
back.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," he protested lamely,
"when you marry for money you generally
get it, don't you? But when
you marry for love&mdash;it's like putting
your last dollar on a long shot."</p>

<p>"If you mean there's a delightful
uncertainty about it?" began the
widow.</p>

<p>"There's nothing half so delightful,"
declared the bachelor, "as
betting on a sure thing. Now, the
man or woman who marries for
money&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Earns it," broke in the widow fervently.
"Earns it by the sweat of the
brow. The man who marries a
woman for her money is a white
slave, a bond servant, a travesty on
manhood. For every dollar he receives
he gives a full equivalent in
self-respect and independence, and
all the things dearest to a real man."</p>

<p>"A real man," remarked the bachelor,
taking out his pipe and lighting
it, "wouldn't marry a woman for her
money. It's woman to whom marriage
presents the alluring financial
prospect."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," responded the
widow, crossing her arms behind her
head and leaning thoughtfully
against the tree at her back. "In
these days of typewriting and stenography
and manicuring and trained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
nursing, matrimony offers about the
poorest returns, from a business
standpoint, of any feminine occupation&mdash;the
longest hours, the hardest
work, the greatest drain on your
patience, the most exacting master
and the smallest pay, to say nothing
of no holidays and not even an evening
off."</p>

<p>"Nor a chance to 'give notice' if
you don't like your job," added the
bachelor sympathetically.</p>

<p>"If the average business man,"
went on the widow, ignoring the interruption,
"demanded half of his
stenographer that he demands of his
wife he couldn't keep her three
hours."</p>

<p>"And yet," remarked the bachelor,
pulling on his pipe meditatively,
"the average stenographer is only too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
glad to exchange her position for that
of wife whenever she gets&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The jangle of gold bangles, as the
widow brought her arms down from
behind her head and sat up straight,
interrupted his speech.</p>

<p>"Whenever she gets&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The widow picked up her ruffles
and started to rise.</p>

<p>"Whenever she gets&mdash;ready," finished
the bachelor quickly.</p>

<p>The widow sat down again and
leaned back against the tree.</p>

<p>"How perfectly you illustrate my
point," she remarked sweetly.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the bachelor, taking his
pipe out of his mouth, "did you have
a point?"</p>

<p>"That marriage is something
higher and finer than a business
proposition, Mr. Travers, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
there are lots of reasons for marrying
besides financial ones."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," agreed the bachelor,
"there is folly and feminine coercion
and because you can't get out of it,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As for marriage as a money affair,"
pursued the widow without
waiting, "it's just the money side of
it that causes all the squabbles and
unhappiness. If they've got it, they
are always quarreling over it and if
they haven't got it they are always
quarreling for it. The Castellanes
and Marlboroughs who fight over
their bills and their debts aren't any
happier than the Murphys and the
Hooligans who fight over the price
of a pint of beer. It's just as difficult
to know what to do with money
when you've got it as it is to know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
what to do without it when you
haven't got it; and a million dollars
between husband and wife is a bigger
gulf than a $10 a week salary.
It's not a question of the amount of
money, but the question of who shall
spend it that makes all the trouble."</p>

<p>"But don't you see," argued the
bachelor, sitting up suddenly and
knocking the ashes out of his pipe,
"that all that would be eliminated if
people would make marriage a business
proposition? For instance, if
two people would discuss the situation
rationally and make the terms
before marriage; if the man would
state the services he requires and the
woman would demand the compensation
she thinks she deserves&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ugh!" shuddered the widow,
putting her hands over her eyes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
"that would be like writing your
epitaph and choosing the style of
your coffin."</p>

<p>"And every man," pursued the
bachelor, "would be willing to give
his wife her board and room and a
salary adequate to her services and to
his income&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And to let her eat with the family,"
jeered the widow.</p>

<p>"Well," finished the bachelor,
"then marriage wouldn't offer the
poorest returns in the professional
market. And, besides," he added,
"there would be fewer wives sitting
about in apartment hotels holding
their hands and ordering the bellboys
around, while their husbands are
down town fretting and struggling
themselves into bankruptcy; and
fewer husbands spending their nights<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and their money out with the boys,
while their wives are bending over
the cook stove and the sewing
machine, trying to make ends meet
on nothing a year."</p>

<p>"But that," cried the widow, taking
her hands down from her eyes,
"would mean spending your courtship
talking stocks and bonds and
dividends!"</p>

<p>"And the rest of your life forgetting
them and talking love," declared
the bachelor, triumphantly.</p>

<p>The widow looked up speculatively.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;perhaps," she acquiesced,
"if courtship were more of a business
proposition marriage would be
less of a failure. Anyhow, you'd
know in advance just what a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
considered you worth in dollars and
cents."</p>

<p>"And you'd eliminate all the uncertainty,"
added the bachelor.</p>

<p>"And the chance of having to beg
for your carfare and pin money."</p>

<p>"And of having to go bankrupt
for matinee tickets and Easter hats."</p>

<p>"And of being asked what you did
with your allowance."</p>

<p>"Or of how you acquired your
breath or lost your watch."</p>

<p>"The trouble is," sighed the
widow, "that no man would ever be
broad enough or generous enough to
make such a proposition."</p>

<p>"And no woman would ever be
sensible enough to listen to it."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. Any woman would.
It's just the sort of thing we've been
longing for."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said the bachelor, turning
on his back and looking up at the
widow speculatively, "let me see&mdash;you
could have the violet room."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed the widow.</p>

<p>"It's got a good south view," protested
the bachelor, "and besides it's
not over the kitchen."</p>

<p>"What on earth do you mean?"
The widow sat up straight and her
bangles jingled warningly.</p>

<p>"And you could have Saturday
and Wednesday evenings out. Those
are my club nights."</p>

<p>"How dare you!"</p>

<p>"And any salary you might ask&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What are you talking about, Billy
Travers?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 370px;">
<img src="images/illus-4.jpg" width="370" height="500" alt="&quot;YOU&#39;VE taken all the poetry out of it.&quot; Page 72" title="" />
<div class='cap'><span class="caption">&quot;YOU&#39;VE taken all the poetry out of it.&quot;</span></div><br /> <div class='pagref'><i>Page 72</i></div>
</div>

<p>"I'm making you a proposal of
marriage," explained the bachelor in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
an injured tone. "Don't you recognize
it?"</p>

<p>The widow rose silently, lifted the
sheet of paper in her hands and tore
it to pieces.</p>

<p>"Was that your poem?" inquired
the bachelor as he watched the
breeze carry the fragments away over
the grass.</p>

<p>The widow shook out her ruffles
and picked up her hat.</p>

<p>"You've taken all the poetry out of
it," she retorted, as she fled toward
the house.</p>

<p>The bachelor looked after her undecidedly
for a moment. Then he
leaned back lazily and blinked up at
the sky between the leaves.</p>

<p>"And this," he said softly, "is the
white man's burden."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Signs and Countersigns of Love</span>.</h3>


<div class='cap'>"IF there were only some way,"
began the bachelor, gazing
thoughtfully out of the window
of the dining car, "in
which a fellow could prove his
love&mdash;&mdash;"</div>

<p>"There are millions of them!" declared
the widow, sipping her consomm&eacute;
daintily.</p>

<p>"Those medi&aelig;val fellows had such
an advantage over us," complained
the bachelor. "When a chap loved
a girl, all he had to do to prove it was
to get another chap to say he didn't,
and then to break the other chap's
head. That was a sure sign."</p>

<p>"And it was so easy," remarked the
widow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," agreed the bachelor, enthusiastically.
"Is there anybody whose
head you particularly want broken?
I feel remarkably like fighting."</p>

<p>"Of course, you do," said the
widow sympathetically. "The fighting
spirit is born in every man. But
duelling isn't a sign of love; it's a
sign of egotism, hurt pride, the spirit
of competition, the dog-in-the-manger
feeling. Besides, it's out of fashion."</p>

<p>"Well," sighed the bachelor, "then
I suppose I shall have to save your
life or&mdash;die for you."</p>

<p>"You might," said the widow,
nodding encouragingly, "but it
wouldn't prove anything&mdash;except
that you had a sense of the picturesque
and dramatic. Suppose you
did save my life; wouldn't you do as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
much for any man, woman or child,
or even any little stray dog who
might happen to fall out of a boat or
be caught in a fire, or get under the
feet of a runaway?"</p>

<p>"I've got it!" cried the bachelor,
"I'll write a book of poems and
dedicate them to you."</p>

<p>The widow toyed with her spoon.</p>

<p>"You've done that to&mdash;several girls
before," she remarked ungratefully.</p>

<p>"That's it!" cried the bachelor.
"How is a man going to tell when
he's in love when he feels the same
way&mdash;every time?"</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten your soup?"
asked the widow, glancing at the untouched
plate in front of the bachelor.</p>

<p>The bachelor picked up his spoon
languidly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," he said, "but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because if you had," said the
widow, "it would have been a proof."</p>

<p>"A&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"A proof," repeated the widow.
"Forgetting to eat your meals is the
first sign of love. A man may write
poetry and swear love by all the
planets separately; but if he sits down
opposite you an hour afterward and
orders mutton chops and gravy and
devours them to the last crumb,
either he doesn't mean what he says
or doesn't know what he is talking
about. When he lets his breakfast
grow cold and forgets to go out to his
lunch and loses his interest in his dinner
it's a sure sign of love."</p>

<p>"It might be a sign of dyspepsia,"
suggested the bachelor doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," proceeded the widow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
sipping her soup leisurely, "there are
other signs besides a lost appetite."</p>

<p>The bachelor looked hopeful.</p>

<p>"Is one of them smelling violets all
day, when there aren't any 'round;
and feeling a funny jump in your
throat every time you catch sight of a
violet hat; and suddenly discovering
you have written, 'Send me eight
quarts of violets and a widow,' instead
of 'eight quarts of gasoline and
a patent pump'?"</p>

<p>The widow leaned so far over her
soup that her eyes were completely
shaded by the brim of her violet hat.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said gently, "loss of
reason is one of them&mdash;and loss of
memory."</p>

<p>"And loss of sleep?"</p>

<p>"And loss of common sense."</p>

<p>"And loss of self-respect?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"And of your powers of conversation."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" cried the bachelor, "a
man in love can say more fool
things&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The widow put down her spoon
emphatically.</p>

<p>"A man in love," she contradicted,
"can't talk at all? It's not the things
he says, but the things he isn't able to
say; the things that choke right up
in his throat&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've had that!" interrupted the
bachelor.</p>

<p>"Had&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"The 'love-lump' in the throat."</p>

<p>"And did you ever go up stairs to
light the gas and turn on the water
instead; or walk three blocks in the
wrong direction without knowing it;
or hunt ten minutes for your shoes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and then discover it was your collar
button or your hat that you had lost?"</p>

<p>"Or add a column of figures and
get a poem for the answer; or break
your neck running to the office and
then have to sit down and think what
you came down early for; or begin a
business letter 'Dearest Smith' and
drop it in the box without a stamp,
or read your paper upside down,
or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've got it!" cried the widow.</p>

<p>"I know it," sighed the bachelor,
"dreadfully!"</p>

<p>"The idea, I mean," said the
widow, blushing. "Those are the
real proofs of love."</p>

<p>"But," protested the bachelor,
"they aren't impressive. How are
you going to let the girl know&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"A girl always knows," declared
the widow.</p>

<p>"Are you going to say, 'Araminta,
darling, I put on odd socks this morning
and salted my coffee and sugared
my chop.' Accept this as a proof?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no," said the widow,
laughing, "of course not! But when
you arrive at her house half an hour
before the time and appear at odd
and embarrassing moments without a
rational excuse and get mixed on
your dates and look at her as if she
were the moon or a ghost, and might
disappear at any moment, and sit for
hours gazing into space and moistening
your lips in the hope that you
will think of something to say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She knows that she's got you!"
groaned the bachelor.</p>

<p>"Oh, she may not," declared the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
widow, cheerfully. "She may not
know anything. She may be in love
herself."</p>

<p>"That's it!" protested the bachelor,
"knowing you're in love is only half
the trouble. How are you going to
know when a girl has reached the
love stage? How are you going to
know that she is not just dangling
you, or marrying you for your
money? They're so clever and wise
and coquettish and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When a girl is in love," said the
widow, "she ceases being clever and
wise and coquettish. She becomes
mooney and silent and begins to
notice things about you that you
never knew yourself, such as that
your nose is like Napoleon's or that
you have a profile like E. H. Sothern
and shoulders like Hackett's and hair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
like Kyrle Bellew's. She never keeps
you waiting, but is always dressed
and sitting in the parlor an hour before
you arrive and is never in a
hurry to get home and will walk for
blocks beside you in the rain with her
best hat on without caring. She begins
to 'mother' you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To what?"</p>

<p>"To caution you about getting
your feet wet and avoiding a draught
and wearing your overcoat and to
look at you every time you leave her
as if she was afraid you would die
before morning and&mdash;Mr. Travers,
do you know I believe this train has
reached Jersey City?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;so it has! Waiter!
Waiter! Where in thunder is that
blockhead? Why hasn't he brought
us the rest of the dinner?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"You forgot to order it!" said the
widow, looking maliciously up under
her hat.</p>

<p>"Jersey City! Last stop!" called
the conductor from the door.</p>

<p>The bachelor put down his napkin
and rose.</p>

<p>"Check, sir?" asked the waiter,
with accusing eyes.</p>

<p>"Were you forgetting to pay?" inquired
the widow, softly.</p>

<p>The bachelor thrust a bill into the
waiter's hands and started down the
aisle, followed by the widow.</p>

<p>"You forgot your change," remarked
the widow, as they stepped
into the depot.</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind," said the bachelor.
"Where are your wraps?"</p>

<p>The widow clutched his sleeve.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;left them in the dining
car," she stammered.</p>

<p>The bachelor gazed down at the
top of the violet hat with a triumphant
smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, do go back and try to get
them!" moaned the widow glancing
wildly at the train, which by this time
was being switched onto a side track.</p>

<p>"It will be at the risk of my life,"
declared the bachelor, "but if you
want&mdash;any more&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"More&mdash;what?" asked the widow,
distractedly.</p>

<p>"Proof," said the bachelor.</p>

<p>"It isn't necessary," said the
widow, as she spied an excited porter
running toward them, clutching a
pongee coat, a silver hand bag and
a violet parasol.</p>

<p>"These," said the bachelor, taking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
them tenderly from the porter and
tipping him, "are the most substantial
signs of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A lost head," said the widow
quickly.</p>

<p>"Or a lost heart," added the bachelor,
as they crossed the station and
stepped fatuously on to&mdash;the wrong
ferryboat.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Short Cut</span>.</h3>


<div class='cap'>"WHAT ought I to do,"
asked the widow,
carefully licking all
the gum off the flap
of a violet envelope and then trying
to make it stick, "to a silly boy, who&mdash;asked
me for a kiss?"</div>

<p>"What ought you to do?" repeated
the bachelor, laying down his cigar
and regarding the widow severely.
"Refuse him, of course."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course," agreed the
widow, rubbing the envelope spasmodically
with the end of her handkerchief,
"but what ought I do to
teach him better?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't think of anything&mdash;better,"
replied the bachelor, charitably
reaching for the violet envelope and
closing it firmly with his fist.</p>

<p>"How about just taking the kiss&mdash;without
asking for it?" inquired the
widow naively, as she leaned luxuriously
back among the cushions of the
divan. "Wouldn't that have been
better&mdash;for him, I mean?"</p>

<p>"Would it?" The bachelor looked
the widow straight in the eye.</p>

<p>"Well," replied the widow weakly,
toying with some fringe on a satin
sofa pillow and carefully avoiding
the bachelor's gaze, "he would have
gotten it."</p>

<p>"And now he never will," rejoined
the bachelor with a confidence he did
not feel.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know." The widow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
became suddenly interested in the
arrangement of the fringe on the
satin sofa pillow. "But it isn't the
man who asks a woman for a kiss or&mdash;or
anything&mdash;who gets it. It's the
man who takes for granted."</p>

<p>"Takes&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Takes her by surprise, Mr. Travers,"
explained the widow, "and
doesn't give her time to think or to
say no. The short cut to managing a
woman is not argument or reason.
It's action. She may like to be
coaxed, but it's the man who orders
her about whom she admires&mdash;and
obeys. Eve has never forgotten that
she is only a rib and when Adam forgets
it, she&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Makes him feel like a small part
of the vertebr&aelig;," interpolated the
bachelor tentatively.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Naturally," returned the widow,
tying the sofa pillow fringe in a hard
knot and then untying it again, "when
a man comes to her on his knees she
is clever enough to keep him there;
but when he comes to her with a
scepter in his hand and determination
in his eye, she has a wholesome
respect for him. It's not the man
who begs but the one who demands
that receives. It's not the man who
asks a girl to marry him, but the one
who tells her that she is going to
marry him, who gets her. It's not
the husband who requests the
privilege of carrying a latch-key or
staying down town at night who can
do so without fear and trembling, but
the one who calmly takes the latch-key
and telephones his wife that he is
going to stay down town and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
rings off as though the matter were
settled. The question of who's going
to have the whip hand in love or
matrimony is decided the very first
time a man looks at a woman and lets
her know who's master."</p>

<p>The bachelor flicked the ashes off
his cigar and regarded the widow
curiously.</p>

<p>"Are you talking Christian
Science or Hypnotism?" he inquired
patiently.</p>

<p>"Neither," replied the widow,
"I'm talking facts, Mr. Travers.
Haven't you ever seen a little short-legged
man with a snub nose married
to a beautiful, queenly creature,
whom he ordered about as if she
were the original Greek slave and
who obeyed him as if he were Nero
himself, and adored him in proportion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to his overbearing qualities?
And have you never seen a magnificent,
six-foot-two specimen of masculine
humanity, who was first in
war and first everywhere but in his
own home, where he was afraid to
put his feet on a chair or light a pipe
or make an original remark, because
some little dried-up runt of a woman
had him hypnotized into believing
that he was the thirty-second vertebr&aelig;
and she all the rest of the bones
and sinew of the human race? A
woman is like a darky, who fancies
that 'freedom' means three-quarters of
the sidewalk, or a small boy who imagines
that doing as he pleases means
smashing his sister's toys and stealing
sweets from the pantry. Put her in
her place and she will stay there; but
give her an inch of power and she'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
take an ell of liberty and boss you off
your own door sill. The biggest,
boldest woman that ever lived is built
like a barge, to be towed; and any
little man who puffs up enough steam
and makes a loud enough noise can
attach her to himself and tow her all
the way up the river of life."</p>

<p>The bachelor laid down his cigar
and gazed at the widow in awe.</p>

<p>"And I never knew it," he whispered
huskily.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said the widow, beginning
to toy with the fringe again,
"that you've been asking girls to kiss
you, all this time."</p>

<p>"Not <i>all</i> the time," protested the
bachelor.</p>

<p>"And, of course," continued the
widow maliciously, "they've all refused
you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not <i>all</i>," repeated the bachelor,
pensively.</p>

<p>"What?" The widow glanced up
quickly.</p>

<p>"Once," explained the bachelor
apologetically, "I didn't have a bald
spot."</p>

<p>"When a man asks for a kiss," pursued
the widow, thoughtfully, "a
girl HAS to refuse him; but when he
takes it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She has to take it, too," said the
bachelor, chuckling.</p>

<p>"Would you mind," asked the
widow, ignoring the last flippant bit
of persiflage and picking up the
violet envelope, "posting a letter for
me?"</p>

<p>"May I look at the address?" demanded
the bachelor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's to the boy," began the widow,
"who&mdash;who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Took the roundabout way?" finished
the bachelor, helpfully.</p>

<p>The widow nodded.</p>

<p>"I have written him," she explained,
"that he mustn't&mdash;that it
would be best if he wouldn't come
here any more. That will keep him
in his place, I think."</p>

<p>"On his knees?" inquired the
bachelor sarcastically.</p>

<p>"And I told him," proceeded the
widow, with a reproachful glance at
the bachelor, "how very rude and
foolish&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did you explain," interrupted the
bachelor, "that the foolishness consisted
in not taking the kiss?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Travers!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"And that the rudeness lay entirely
in assuming that you might not
want to be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How dare you!" cried the widow,
flaming as red as the scarlet satin sofa
pillow behind her head. "I gave him
a dreadful scolding!" she added,
looking pensively at the sealed note
and toying with the edge of the flap,
as though she half wished it would
come open again.</p>

<p>"In other words," remarked the
bachelor laconically, "having him
down, you proceeded to wipe your
feet on him. Since he had turned the
left cheek, you made him turn all the
way round, so that you could stick
pins in his back and make him feel
like the thirty-second vertebr&aelig;
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I had to, Mr. Travers," cried the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
widow pleadingly. "It was my duty."</p>

<p>"Your&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"To teach him a lesson," explained
the widow promptly. "He's got to
learn that in the situation between
man and woman there's only one
throne and that whoever gets up on
it first wields the sceptre. He's got
to learn that the conquest of woman
is not, like the Battle of Waterloo, an
affair of strategy, but like the Battle
of Bunker Hill or Sennacherib&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or the Boston Tea Party or the
Massacre of the Innocents," broke in
the bachelor. "But aren't you a little
hard on the girl? If you get him too
well trained he'll beat her."</p>

<p>"Well," replied the widow
promptly, "if he does she'll adore
him. Besides, it's much better to
have the matrimonial medicine administered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
in allopathic doses than in
the little homeopathic pellets of caution
and deceit, and lies and arguments
which end in the divorce court,
and a woman enjoys being bossed and
bullied and ordered about by the man
she loves quite as much as he enjoys
the bossing and bullying. It's her
natural instinct to look up, but she
can't look up to a man who is figuratively
at her feet. She may struggle
against the man who attempts to conquer
her by main force, but she enjoys
being conquered just the same,
and it takes a great burden off her
soul to be able to lay her head on a
broad, masculine shoulder and to
know that every affair in life is going
to be settled and decided for her.</p>

<p>"She may talk about thinking for
herself and voting and all that, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
she is always glad enough to sit back
and be thought for and voted for by
some man who has magnetized her
into believing him the incarnation of
intelligence. And any man can do it.
If the average husband only had a
little more nerve and fewer nerves, he
could master his wife with one hand
and his eyes shut. The heathen Turk
can get along better with a whole
harem full of women than the civilized
man gets along with one lone,
lorn wife. It isn't because he's any
wiser or cleverer or kinder, but because
the first Turk learned the short
cut to managing a woman and passed
the secret down in the family. They
don't ask them to marry them over
there, they order them; they don't request
them to run an errand or sew
on a button, they merely wave their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
hands and the women fight for the
privilege of obeying. They have
known for ages what the white man
never seems to have learned, that the
way to take a woman is by storm and
the way to hold her is by force and
that any man can manage any woman
if he only knows how and has the
audacity and the courage&mdash;What are
you trying to do, Mr. Travers?"</p>

</div>

<p>"I'm taking a short cut to the
divan," replied the bachelor, sitting
down beside the widow, "and I've
got the courage at last&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How dare you, Billy Travers!"</p>

<p>"And the audacity&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop! Stop!"</p>

<p>"And the nerve&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Taylor," announced the
maid, appearing suddenly between
the portieres at this critical moment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, mercy!" cried the widow,
"and my hair is just&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Am I intruding?" asked a fresh-faced
young man, entering briskly
between the portieres.</p>

<p>"Not at all, Bobby," said the
widow sweetly, holding out one hand
and feeling her back hair with the
other. "You arrived just at the&mdash;psychological
moment. We have
been talking about you for the last
half hour."</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">After Love</span>&mdash;&mdash;(?)</h3>


<div class='cap'>"WHY is it," asked the
widow, swinging her
chatelaine pensively
as she strolled down
the avenue beside the bachelor, "that
the man who is most in love is most
apt to get over it suddenly?"</div>

<p>The bachelor withdrew his eyes
from the pretty pair of ankles across
the street and glanced down at the
widow with the lenient smile of
superior wisdom.</p>

<p>"Why is it," he retorted, "that the
man who drinks the most champagne
at dinner has the worst headache next
morning?"</p>

<p>"That isn't any explanation at all,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Mr. Travers." The widow's chatelaine
jingled impatiently. "Champagne
is intoxicating."</p>

<p>"So is love."</p>

<p>"Champagne leaves you with an&mdash;an
all-gone feeling."</p>

<p>"And love leaves you with&mdash;'that
tired feeling'."</p>

<p>"Not me," said the widow
promptly, "I always feel exhilarated
after&mdash;after&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Afterwards," finished the bachelor
helpfully. "But you're a woman.
It's the man who has the 'tired feeling'."</p>

<p>"What is it like?" persisted the
widow.</p>

<p>"Well," the bachelor flipped his
cane thoughtfully, "did you ever eat
a fourteen course dinner, and then go
to Sherry's afterward for supper and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
then go to Delmonico's for a snack
and to Rector's for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've been through it," sighed the
widow.</p>

<p>"You didn't want any more, did
you?" asked the bachelor sympathetically.
"That's the way a man feels
when he's had enough of love&mdash;or a
woman."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but love isn't indigestible."</p>

<p>"Too much of anything&mdash;love or
dinner or champagne&mdash;is apt to take
away your appetite. And too much
of a woman is sure to make you hate
the sight of her."</p>

<p>The widow's chatelaine was dancing
madly in the afternoon sunlight.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose," she said witheringly,
"that it would be possible for
a woman to get too much of a man!"</p>

<p>"No," agreed the bachelor cheerfully,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
as he squinted at another pair
of pretty ankles, "women are sentimental
topers. They sip their wine
or their sentiment slowly and comfortably;
they don't gulp it down like
a man. That's why the man has
usually finished the bottle before the
woman has touched her glass. He is
ready to turn out the lights and put
an end to the affair just as she has
begun to get really interested. But,"
and the bachelor turned suddenly
upon the widow, "who is the man?
Show him to me!" and he brought
his cane down fiercely on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"Wh-what man?" asked the
widow, turning pink to the tips of
her ears.</p>

<p>"The man who has jilt&mdash;gotten
over it. I don't see how it's possible,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
he added thoughtfully, "with you."</p>

<p>"Me!" The widow's voice was as
chill and crisp as the autumn air. "I
wish," she added musingly, "that I
knew how to patch it up."</p>

<p>"That's right!" retorted the bachelor.
"Try to revive his interest in
champagne by offering it to him&mdash;the
morning after. What he needs,
my dear lady, is&mdash;ice. When he has
had a little ice and a little tabasco
sauce&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He may want more champagne?"
asked the widow hopefully.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the bachelor, swinging
his cane cheerfully, "but not from
the same bottle. Will women ever
learn," he mused, "that it is as impossible
to revive a man's interest in
a woman he has completely gotten
over loving as to make him want stale<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
champagne with all the fizz gone out
of it?"</p>

<p>"I don't see why," said the widow.
"A woman often falls in love with
the same man twice."</p>

<p>"Because she never falls too much
in love with him&mdash;once," explained
the bachelor.</p>

<p>The widow's chatelaine rattled indignantly.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" she cried, "A woman's
love is always stronger and deeper
than a man's."</p>

<p>"But it isn't so effervescent. She is
a natural miser and she hoards her
feelings. A man flings his sentiment
about like a prodigal and naturally
when it's all gone&mdash;there isn't any
left."</p>

<p>"Is that when he gets the 'tired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
feeling?'" inquired the widow sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the bachelor, "and
nothing is worse than waking up in
the morning with a dark brown taste
in your mouth&mdash;to find the woman
standing before you offering you
more champagne. But she always
does. A woman never seems to know
when the logical conclusion of a love
affair has arrived. She clings with
all her strength to the tattered remnants
of sentiment and shuts her eyes
and tries to make believe it isn't
morning, when she ought to go
away&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And let him sleep it off," suggested
the widow.</p>

<p>"That's it," agreed the bachelor, "I
once knew a man who was infatuated
with a woman who used attar of roses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
on her gloves and things. When he
woke up&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;after
they had broken off, he never could
abide the smell of roses."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said the widow, holding
her muff against her cheek sentimentally,
"it reminded him of all
the tender little t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes and
moonlight nights and the way her
hair curled about her forehead and
the way she used to smile at him, and
of her gloves and her ruffles and the
color of her eyes and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It didn't!" said the bachelor emphatically.
"It nauseated him. It's
the woman who always remembers
the pleasant part of a love affair. A
man remembers only&mdash;the next
morning&mdash;and the hard time he had
getting out of it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"And the headache," added the
widow.</p>

<p>"And the 'tired feeling'."</p>

<p>"And the other woman," suggested
the widow contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed the bachelor, "the
other woman, of course. But," he
added thoughtfully, "if a woman
could only take the hint in time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What time?" asked the widow.
"When a man begins to be late for
his engagements?"</p>

<p>"Yes; or to forget them altogether."</p>

<p>"And to make excuses and enlarge
on his rush of business."</p>

<p>"And to seem abstracted during
the conversation."</p>

<p>"And to stop noticing her jokes or
her frocks or the way she does her
hair."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"And to stay away from places
where he could be sure to meet her."</p>

<p>"But," protested the widow, "they
always make such plausible excuses."</p>

<p>"Nothing," said the bachelor confidently,
"will keep a man away from
a woman except a lack of interest in
her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or an interest in another
woman," added the widow promptly.
"But," she concluded tentatively,
"there ought to be a cure for it."</p>

<p>"For what? The other woman?"</p>

<p>"That tired feeling, Mr. Travers."</p>

<p>"There isn't any cure," replied the
bachelor promptly, "but there's a
good preventive. When you were a
very little girl," he continued patronizingly,
"and liked jam&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I like it now!" declared the
widow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"How did your mother manage to
preserve your interest in it?"</p>

<p>"She took the jam away, Mr.
Travers, and put it on the top shelf
always&mdash;just before I had had
enough."</p>

<p>"Well, that's the way to preserve a
man's interest in a woman," declared
the bachelor. "Deal yourself out to
him in homeopathic doses. Put
yourself on the top shelf, where it is
hard for him to get at you. Feed him
sugar out of a teaspoon; don't pass
him the whole sugar bowl. Then he
will be always begging for more.
One only wants more of anything
that one can't get enough of, you
know. Now, if a woman would use
her judgment&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As if a woman in love had any
judgment!" mocked the widow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's it!" sighed the bachelor,
"She never has. She just lays the
whole feast before the man, flings all
her charms at his head at once, surfeits
him with the champagne of her
wit and lets him eat all the sugar off
his cake right away. The love affair
springs up like a mushroom and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, well," interrupted the widow
impatiently, "I like mushroom love
affairs. I like a man who can fling
himself headlong into an affair
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course you do!" sighed the
bachelor, "every woman does. The
sensible and temperate man who will
love her all his life&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A little!" said the widow contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Well, a little is enough," retorted
the bachelor, "at a time."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"That depends," said the widow,
"on how many times&mdash;one is loved.
There are some women who are so
saving of their sugar and frugal with
their sentiment that they never know
the real joy of a grand passion or of
having a man love them properly.
What's the use of having money if
you are always going to keep it in the
bank?" she added conclusively.</p>

<p>The bachelor looked down at her
and said nothing. There was a smile
of hopeless resignation in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Here we are!" cried the widow,
suddenly stopping in front of a tall
brownstone house and holding out
her hand politely. "So glad to
have&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to invite me
in?" demanded the bachelor, in astonishment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>The widow lifted her eyebrows in
faint surprise.</p>

<p>"What," she asked sweetly,
"after&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You broke an engagement with
me last night!" blurted out the
bachelor, looking the widow straight
in the eyes. But the widow shifted
her gaze to the park across the street
and swung her chatelaine indifferently.</p>

<p>"And you weren't 'at home' to me
the day before yesterday and you
were out of town for a week before
that; and you promised me that this
afternoon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did I?" asked the widow, looking
up innocently.</p>

<p>"Yes, you did!" declared the
bachelor.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," laughed the widow, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
she tripped up the steps with a wave
of her muff, "I was only showing you
the sugar bowl; but I didn't mean
you could have another spoonful; besides,"
she added, turning round and
talking through the tunnel in her
muff, "there's somebody waiting inside."</p>

<p>"Who?" demanded the bachelor.</p>

<p>"The man with the 'tired feeling',"
said the widow.</p>

<p>"But," began the bachelor in a
puzzled voice, "if he is tired of&mdash;of
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Me!" the widow laughed. "He
isn't tired of me, Mr. Travers. It's&mdash;the
other woman. He came to me
for&mdash;for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A bracer?" suggested the bachelor.
"What are you going to give
him?" he added.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Vinegar, mustard, pepper, salt,"
said the widow counting off the buttons
of her coat, child fashion.</p>

<p>The bachelor looked at her out of
the corner of his eye.</p>

<p>"Anything else?" he asked.</p>

<p>"A little&mdash;ice," said the widow,
gazing out over the park.</p>

<p>"Anything else?" persisted the
bachelor.</p>

<p>The widow studied her muff musingly.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I don't know," she said,
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Any&mdash;sugar?" demanded the
bachelor.</p>

<p>The widow shook her head smilingly.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I'm saving that
for another&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Another!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"Another time," said the widow
ambiguously as she let the door close
softly behind her.</p>

<h2>IX</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Her Way</span>.</h3>


<div class='cap'>"THERE," said the bachelor,
as he nodded amiably
at the big, jolly-looking
man beside the little,
weazened woman, "is the best husband
the Lord ever made!"</div>

<p>"The Lord!" said the widow
scornfully. "It isn't the Lord who
makes husbands. It's the wife!"</p>

<p>"And I always thought God made
Adam," sighed the bachelor, humbly.</p>

<p>"Adam," said the widow promptly,
as she dropped another lump of sugar
into her tea, "wasn't a husband. He
was only a man. And a man is only&mdash;raw
material. He is like a ready-made
frock or a ready-made coat; he
has got to be cut down and built up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and ironed out and taken in and to
have all the raw edges trimmed off
before he is properly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Finished?" suggested the bachelor.</p>

<p>The widow nodded cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Yes," she agreed, "and adjusted to
matrimony. And even then sometimes
he is a dreadful botch."</p>

<p>"And all his style is gone," sighed
the bachelor.</p>

<p>The widow studied her S&eacute;vres cup
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Well," she admitted, "sometimes
the material is so bad or so skimpy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>The widow smiled patiently.</p>

<p>"Skimpy," she repeated. "There
is so little to some men that the cleverest
woman couldn't patch them up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
into a full-sized specimen. They are
like the odds and ends left on the
remnant counter. You have to do the
best you can with them and then use
Christian Science to make yourself
believe they are all there and that the
patches don't show. Haven't you
ever seen magnificent women trailing
little annexes after them like echoes
or&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Captives in the wake of a conquering
queen?" broke in the bachelor.</p>

<p>The widow studied her S&eacute;vres cup
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: these words not present in original text">as the</ins> purple plume on her hat danced.</p>

<p>"Those," she exclaimed, "are the
bargain-counter husbands, picked up
at the last moment and made over to
fit the situation&mdash;which they never
do."</p>

<p>The bachelor set down his teacup<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
with the light of revelation in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"And I always thought," he exclaimed
solemnly, "that they were
picked out on purpose to act as
shadows or&mdash;or satellites."</p>

<p>"Picked out!" echoed the widow
mockingly. "As if all women
wouldn't be married to Greek gods or
Napoleon Bonapartes or Wellingtons
or Byrons if they could 'pick out' a
husband. Husbands are like Christmas
gifts. You can't choose them.
You've just got to sit down and wait
until they arrive; and sometimes they
don't arrive at all. A woman doesn't
'pick out' a husband; she 'picks over'
what's offered and takes the best of
the lot."</p>

<p>"And sometimes you're so long
picking them over," added the bachelor,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
"that the best ones are snapped
up by somebody else and you have to
take the left-overs."</p>

<p>The widow poised her spoon above
her cup tentatively.</p>

<p>"Well," she sighed, "it's all a lottery
anyhow. The girl who snaps up
her first offer of marriage is as likely
to get something good as the one who
snaps her finger at it and waits for a
Prince Charming until the last hour
and then discovers that she has passed
him by and that some other woman
has taken him and made him over
beautifully. And even if a girl had
the whole world to select from, she
wouldn't know how to choose. You
never can tell by the way a thing
looks under the electric light in the
shop how it will look in broad daylight
when you have got it home, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
how it will make up or whether it
will fade or run or shrink. And you
never can tell by the way a man acts
before marriage how he will come
out in the wash of domesticity, or
stand the wear and tear of matrimony.
It's usually the most brilliant
and catchy patterns of manhood that
turn out to be cotton-backed after the
gloss of the honeymoon has worn off.
And on the other hand you may carefully
select something serviceable&mdash;dull
and virtuous and worthy and all
that&mdash;and he may prove so stiff and
lumpy and set in his ways and cross-grained
and seamy and irritable that
you will cultivate gray hairs and
wrinkles&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ironing him out?" suggested the
bachelor.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed the widow, "and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
wildest 'jolly good fellow' will often
tame down like a lamb or a pet pony
in harness and will become a joy forever
with a little trimming off and
taking in and basting up."</p>

<p>"Humph," protested the bachelor,
"but when you catch 'em wild and
tame 'em, how do you know they are
not going to break the harness or
burst the basting threads?"</p>

<p>The widow considered a moment.</p>

<p>"You don't," she acknowledged
grudgingly. "But there is a great
deal in catching the wild variety and
domesticating them while they are
young. Of course, it's utterly impossible
to subdue a lion after he has got
his second teeth, and it's utterly foolish
to try to reform a man&mdash;after he is
thirty or has begun to lose his hair.
Besides," she added, "there is so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
much in the woman who does the
training and the making over. There
are some women who could spoil the
finest masculine cloth in the world by
too much cutting and ripping and&mdash;and
nagging; while there are others
who can give a man or a house or a
frock just the touch that will perfect
them."</p>

<p>"How do they do it?" asked the
bachelor enthusiastically. "Take 'em
by the nape of the neck and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

</div>

<p>"Mercy, no!" cried the widow.
"They take them unawares. The
well-trained husband never knows
what has happened to him. He only
knows that, after ten years of matrimony,
he is ashamed to acknowledge
his own youthful picture. He has
been literally re-formed in everything
from his collars and the way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
he parts his hair to his morals and
the way he signs his name. The best
husbands aren't caught; they're
made. And the luckiest woman isn't
the one who marries the best man,
but the one who makes the most out
of the man she marries."</p>

<p>"But," protested the bachelor, "if
we're such a lot and such a lottery,
why do you marry us at all?"</p>

<p>The widow looked up in surprise
and stopped with her cup poised in
midair.</p>

<p>"Why do we wear frocks, Mr.
Travers?" she asked witheringly.
"Why do we pompadour our hair or
eat with forks or go to pink teas?
Marriage is a custom; and if a
woman doesn't marry she is simply
non&mdash;non&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Compos mentis?" inquired the
bachelor, helpfully.</p>

<p>"Well, yes," said the widow, "but
that wasn't what I meant. What is
the Latin for 'not in it'? Her father
looks at her accusingly every time he
has to pay her dressmaker's bill and
her mother looks at her commiseratingly
every time she comes home
without being engaged and all her
friends look at her as if she were a
curiosity or&mdash;or a failure. And besides,
she misses her mission in life.
That was what the Lord put Eve in
the world for&mdash;to give the finishing
touches to Adam."</p>

<p>"She finished him all right!" exclaimed
the bachelor fervently.</p>

<p>"Making a living," went on the
widow scorning the insinuation, "or
making a career or making fame or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
a fortune isn't the real forte of
woman. It's making a husband&mdash;out
of a man."</p>

<p>"I should think," said the bachelor
setting down his teacup and leaning
back comfortably in his chair, "that
they would form a corporation and
set up a factory where they could
turn 'em out by the dozen or the
crate&mdash;or&mdash;-"</p>

<p>"Pooh!" cried the widow, "a husband
is a work of art and has to be
made by hand. He can't be turned
out by machinery like a chromo or a
lithograph. And, besides, if you
want a ready-made one you can
always find plenty of them on the
second-hand counter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"On the&mdash;where?"</p>

<p>"Where they keep the widowers,"
explained the widow. "If a woman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
isn't interested or clever enough to
manufacture her own husband, she
can always find some man who has
been modeled by another woman.
And she has the satisfaction of knowing
exactly what she's getting and
just what to expect. The only trouble
is that, in case she makes a mistake in
her choice, she never has a chance to
make him over. He has been cut
down and relined and faced and
patched already to his limit."</p>

<p>"And his seams are apt to be shiny
and his temper frayed at the edges,"
declared the bachelor.</p>

<p>"And you have to be very sure that
he fits your disposition."</p>

<p>"And matches your taste."</p>

<p>"And that he won't pinch on the
bank account."</p>

<p>"Nor stretch on the truth."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"And that the other woman hasn't
botched him."</p>

<p>"And even then he's a hand-me-down&mdash;and
may shrink or run or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, widowers don't shrink or
run," retorted the widow. "Matrimony
is a habit with them, and they
feel like a cab-horse out of harness
without it. They long to feel the bit
between their teeth and the gentle
hand on the reins&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the basting threads," added
the bachelor. "I wonder what it's
like," he went on, meditatively.</p>

<p>"You'll never know," said the
widow, setting her cup on the tabourette.
"You're too old."</p>

<p>"Yes, I've got my second teeth,"
sighed the bachelor.</p>

<p>"And your bald spot."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I've sown my second crop
of wild oats."</p>

<p>"And yet," said the widow leaning
her chin in her hand and looking
up thoughtfully under her purple
feather, "it would be a great triumph&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I won't be put in harness!" protested
the bachelor.</p>

<p>The widow considered him
gravely.</p>

<p>"There's plenty of material in
you," she declared. "You could be
trimmed off and cut down and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm too tough to cut!"</p>

<p>"And relined."</p>

<p>"I'm almost moth-eaten now!"
moaned the bachelor.</p>

<p>The widow leaned forward and
scrutinized him with interest.</p>

<p>"It would be a pity," she said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
slowly, "to let the wrong woman
botch you. The next time you propose
to me," she added thoughtfully,
"I think I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did I ever propose to you?"
broke in the bachelor with real
fright.</p>

<p>"Oh, lots of times," said the
widow; "it's almost a habit now."</p>

<p>"But you refused me!" pleaded the
bachelor. "Say you refused me."</p>

<p>"I did," said the widow promptly.
"I wasn't looking for&mdash;remnants."</p>

<p>"Never mind!" retorted the bachelor.
"Some day you may find I've
been grabbed up."</p>

<p>"You'll have lost all your&mdash;starch
and style by then," said the widow as
she patted her back hair and started
for the door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>The bachelor followed, putting on
his gloves.</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" he
asked, when they had bidden their
hostess good-afternoon and stood on
the portico saying goodby.</p>

<p>"Well," said the widow, "it would
take an artist to make you over. The
wrong woman would utterly ruin
you."</p>

<p>"And who is the wrong woman?"
The bachelor tried to look into the
widow's eyes beneath the purple
feather.</p>

<p>But the widow only glanced out
over the lawn and swung her parasol.</p>

<p>"Who is the wrong woman?" persisted
the bachelor.</p>

<p>The widow studied the tip of her
patent leather toe.</p>

<p>"Who is the wrong woman?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>The widow looked up suddenly
under her violet feather.</p>

<p>"The other woman," she said
softly, "of course."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Marriage</span>.</h3>


<div class='cap'>"ISN'T all this talk about 'trial
marriages' absurd?" remarked
the widow, laying her newspaper
on the tabourette and
depositing two small red kid toes on
the edge of the fender.</div>

<p>"It is," agreed the bachelor, cheerfully,
with his eyes on the red kid
toes, "considering that all marriages
are&mdash;trials."</p>

<p>"Just fancy," went on the widow,
scornfully, ignoring the flippancy,
"being leased to a husband or wife
for a period of years, like a flat or a
yacht or&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A second-hand piano," suggested
the bachelor.</p>

<p>"And knowing," continued the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
widow, gazing contemplatively into
the fire, "that when the lease or the
contract or whatever it is expired,
unless the other party cared to renew
it, you would be on the market
again."</p>

<p>"And probably in need of all sorts
of repairs," added the bachelor, reflectively,
"in your temper and your
complexion and your ideas."</p>

<p>"Yes," sighed the widow, "ten
years of married life will rub all the
varnish off your manners, and all the
color off your illusions and all the
finish off your conversation."</p>

<p>"And the hinges of your love making
and your pretty speeches are
likely to creak every time you open
your mouth," affixed the bachelor,
gloomily.</p>

<p>"And you are bound to be old-fashioned,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
concluded the widow, with
conviction, "and to compare badly
with brand-new wives and husbands
with all the modern improvements.
Besides," she continued, thoughtfully,
"even if you should be lucky
enough to find another&mdash;another&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tenant for your heart?" suggested
the bachelor, helpfully.</p>

<p>The widow nodded.</p>

<p>"There would be the agony," she
went on, "of getting used to him or
her."</p>

<p>"And the torture," added the
bachelor, with a faint shudder, "of
going through with the wedding
ceremony again and of walking up a
green and yellow church aisle with
a green and yellow feeling and a stiff
new coat, and the gaping multitude
gazing at you as if you were a new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
specimen of crocodile or a curio
or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It takes nearly all of one lifetime,"
interrupted the widow, impatiently,
"to get used to one wife or
husband; but, according to the 'trial
marriage' idea, just as you had gotten
somebody nicely trained into all your
little ways and discovered how to
manage him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And to bluff him," interpolated
the bachelor.</p>

<p>"And what to have for dinner
when you were going to show him
the bill for a new hat," proceeded the
widow, "and how to keep him at
home nights&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And to separate him from his
money," remarked the bachelor, sarcastically.</p>

<p>"And to make him see things your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
way," concluded the widow, "it
would be time to pack up your trunks
and leave. Any two people," she
continued, meditatively, "can live
together fairly comfortably after
they have discovered the path around
one another's nerves&mdash;the little things
not to say and not to do in order to
avoid friction, and the little things
to say and to do that will oil the
matrimonial wheels. But it would
take all the 'trial' period to get the
domestic machine running, and
then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'd be running after another
soul-mate," finished the bachelor,
sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Yes." The widow crossed the red
kid toes and then drew them quickly
under the ruffles of her skirts as she
caught the bachelor staring at them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
"And&mdash;I've&mdash;forgotten what I was
going to say," she finished, turning
the color of her slippers.</p>

<p>"Oh, it doesn't matter," said the
bachelor, consolingly.</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter what you say,"
explained the bachelor, "it's the way
you say it, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"About soul-mates," broke in the
widow, collecting herself, "there'd
always be the chance," she pursued
hurriedly, "that you'd have to take
a second-hand one."</p>

<p>"Sometimes," remarked the bachelor,
blowing a smoke ring and gazing
through it at the place where the
widow's toes had been, "second-hand
goods are more attractive than
cheap, new articles. For instance,
widows&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, widows!" interrupted the
widow impatiently, "They're different.
They're like heirlooms&mdash;only
parted with at death. But it would be
different with a wife who was relinquished
because she wasn't wanted.
If anybody is anxious to get rid of
something it is a pretty sure sign that
it isn't worth having. It's nearly
always got a flaw somewhere and it's
seldom what it is represented to be.
Besides, I've noticed that the woman
who can't get along with one husband,
usually finds it just as difficult
to get along with another."</p>

<p>"There would always be the
chance," protested the bachelor,
"that you might get the party who
had done the discarding."</p>

<p>"And who might want to do it
again," objected the widow triumphantly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
"Just imagine," she added
irrelevantly, "living with a person
whom somebody else had trained!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that would have its advantages,"
declared the bachelor. "A
horse broken to harness is always
easier to handle."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," agreed the widow leaning
back and thoughtlessly putting
her red kid toes on the fender again,
"but when two horses are going to
travel together it is always best for
them to get used to one another's gait
from the first. Don't you look at it
that way?"</p>

<p>"Which way?" asked the bachelor,
squinting at the fender with his head
on the side.</p>

<p>"Fancy," said the widow not noticing
the deflection, "marrying a man
who had been encouraged to take an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
interest in the household affairs and
having him following you about
picking up things after you; or one,
whose first wife had trained him to
sit by the fire in the evening, and
whom it took a derrick to get to the
theatre or a dinner party; or one who
had been permitted to smoke a pipe
and put his feet all over the furniture
and growl about the meals and
boss the cook!"</p>

<p>"Or to a wife," interpolated the
bachelor, "who had always handled
the funds and monopolized the conversation
and chosen her husband's
collars and who threw all her past
husbands at you every time you did
something she wasn't used to or objected
to something she was used to."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed the widow with a
little shiver, "what horrid things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
two people could say to one another."</p>

<p>"Such as 'Just wait until the lease
is up!'" suggested the bachelor.</p>

<p>The widow nodded.</p>

<p>"Or, 'The next time I marry, I'll
be careful not to take anybody with
red hair,' or, 'Thank goodness it
won't last forever!'" she added.</p>

<p>"That's the beauty of it!" broke in
the bachelor enthusiastically. "It
wouldn't last forever! And the
knowledge that it wouldn't would be
such an an&aelig;sthetic."</p>

<p>"Such a what!" the widow sat up
so suddenly that both toes slipped
from the fender and her heels landed
indignantly on the floor.</p>

<p>"It would be the lump of sugar,"
explained the bachelor, "that would
take away the bitter taste and make
you able to swallow all the trials<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
more easily. It's the feeling that a
painful operation won't last long that
makes it possible to grin and bear it.
Besides, it would do away with all
sorts of crimes, like divorce and wife
murder and ground glass in the
coffee. Knowing that the marriage
was only temporary and that we were
only sort of house-party guests might
make us more polite and agreeable
and entertaining, so as to leave a good
impression behind us."</p>

<p>"I do believe," cried the widow,
sitting up straight and looking at the
bachelor accusingly, "that you're
arguing in favor of 'trial marriage.'"</p>

<p>"I'm not arguing in favor of marriage
at all," protested the bachelor
plaintively. "But marrying for life
is like putting the whole dinner on
the table at once. It takes away your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
appetite. Marrying on trial would
be more like serving it in courses."</p>

<p>"And changing the course would
be such a strain," declared the
widow. "Why, when the contract
was up how would you know how to
divide things&mdash;the children and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The dog and the cat."</p>

<p>"And all the little mementos you
had collected together and the things
you had shared in common and the
favorite arm chair and the things you
had grown used to and fond of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, in that case," remarked
the bachelor, "you might have grown
so used to and fond of one another
that when it came to the parting of
the ways, you would not want to part
them. After all," he went on soberly,
"if 'trial marriages' were put into effect,
they would end nine times out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
of ten in good old fashioned matrimony.
A man can get as accustomed
to a woman as he does to a pipe or a
chair&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"And a woman," pursued the
bachelor, "can become as attached to
a man and as fond of him as she is
of an old umbrella or a pair of old
shoes that have done good service.
No matter how battered or worn they
may become, nor how many breaks
there are in them, we can never find
anything to quite take their place.
Matrimony, after all, is just a habit;
and husbands and wives become
habits&mdash;habits that however disagreeable
they may be we don't want to
part with. 'Trial marriages,' even if
they should be tried, wouldn't alter
things much. As long as two people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
can stand one another they will cling
together anyhow, and if they can't
they won't anyhow; and whether it's
a run out lease or a divorce or prussic
acid that separates them doesn't make
much difference. Custom, not the
wedding certificate, is the tie that
binds most of us. The savage doesn't
need any laws to hold him to the
woman of his choice. Habit does it;
and if habit doesn't the woman will!"</p>

<p>The widow sighed and leaned back
in her chair.</p>

<p>"I suppose so," she said, "but it
seems dreadfully dreary."</p>

<p>"What seems dreadfully dreary?"
inquired the bachelor.</p>

<p>"Matrimony," replied the widow
solemnly. "It IS like those old
chairs and pipes and shoes and things
you were speaking of; it's full of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
holes and breaks and bare spots, and
it won't always work&mdash;but there's
nothing that will quite take the place
of it."</p>

<p>"Nothing," said the bachelor,
promptly. "That's why I want to&mdash;"</p>

<p>The widow rose quickly and shook
out her skirts.</p>

<p>"Now, don't begin that, Billy," she
said, trying to be severe, "you're too
old!"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I'm still in good repair,"
protested the bachelor.</p>

<p>The widow shook her head.</p>

<p>"All the varnish is worn off your
ideals," she objected, "and the hinges
of your enthusiasm creak and you've
got a bare spot on the top of your
head, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

article, and you're genuine and
good style and well preserved, and

<p>"Well?" The bachelor looked up
expectantly.</p>

<p>"If there WERE such a thing as
'trial marriages'&mdash;" The widow hesitated
again.</p>

<p>"You'd give me a trial?" asked the
bachelor eagerly.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the widow, studying
the toes of her red slippers, "it
wouldn't be&mdash;such a trial!"</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Widow's Deal</span>.</h3>


<div class='cap'>"WHO is the ideal
woman?" asked the
widow pensively,
laying down her embroidery
hoop and clasping her
hands behind her head.</div>

<p>The bachelor blew a smoke ring
reflectively and squinted through it
at the widow.</p>

<p>"You've got powder on your nose!"
he remarked disapprovingly.</p>

<p>The widow snatched up a diaphanous
lace handkerchief and began
rubbing her nose.</p>

<p>"Have I got too much on?" she
asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Any," replied the bachelor, with
dignified scorn, "is too much&mdash;in a
man's eyes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>The widow laughed and stopped
rubbing her nose.</p>

<p>"But it isn't in his eyes," she protested,
"if it is put on so artistically
that he doesn't see it. Getting it on
straight is such an art!" and the
widow sighed.</p>

<p>"Black art, you mean," exclaimed
the bachelor disgustedly. "A made-up
woman is like paste jewelry and
imitation bric-a-brac. She looks
cheap and unsubstantial and as
though she wouldn't wear well.
Even granting that you aren't half
good enough for us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"And that you don't come up to
our standards&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The widow dropped her embroidery
hoop and sat up with blazing
eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"You flatter yourself, Mr. Travers!"</p>

<p>"No, I don't!" retorted the bachelor.
"It's you who flatter us, when
you think it necessary to plaster over
your defects and put additions on
your figures and rouge on your
cheeks and frills on your manners.
As a matter of fact," he added decisively,
"a man's ideal is a natural
woman with a natural complexion
and natural hair and natural ways
and natural self-respect."</p>

<p>The widow sighed and took up her
embroidery hoop again.</p>

<p>"I used to think so, too," she said
sadly.</p>

<p>The bachelor lifted his eyebrows
inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Before I discovered," she explained,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
"that it was just as often a
woman with butter-colored hair and
a tailor-made figure and a 'past' and
a manufactured 'bloom of health.'
The truth is," she concluded, stabbing
her needle very carefully into
the centre of an unhealthy looking
green silk rose, "that no two men admire
the same woman, and no one
man admires the same thing in two
women. Now, there's Miss Gunning,
who wears a sweater and says
'damn' and is perfectly natural and
self-respecting and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No man gets ecstatic over a bad
imitation of himself!" expostulated
the bachelor.</p>

<p>"Then why," said the widow, laying
down her needle and fixing the
bachelor with a glittering eye, "do
you spend so much time on the golf<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
links, and out driving and hunting
and walking with her?"</p>

<p>"Because," explained the bachelor,
meekly, "she sometimes hits the ball,
and she can sit in her saddle without
being tied there, and she doesn't grab
the reins nor call a 'hoof' a 'paw.'
But," he added fervently, "I'd take
my hat and run if she asked me to
spend my life with her."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," the widow tossed her
head independently. "She won't.
Miss Gunning can take care of herself."</p>

<p>"That's just it!" pursued the
bachelor. "The very fact that she
can take care of herself and get across
gutters alone and pick up things for
herself and handle her own horse and
beat me at golf and tennis, takes away
that gratifying sense of protection&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"And superiority," interposed the
widow softly.</p>

<p>"That a man likes to feel toward a
woman," concluded the bachelor, ignoring
her. "Muscle and biceps and
a 32-inch waist," he added, "are 'refreshing,'
but in time they get on
your nerves. It may not be immoral
for a dear little thing to say 'damn,'
but it affects a man just as it would
to hear a canary bird squawking like
a parrot. When a chap is going for
a walk cross country he may pick out
the girl with the stride and the strong
back, who can leap a fence and help
herself over puddles, to accompany
him, but when he is ready for a walk
to the altar he naturally prefers
somebody who understands the art of
leaning gently on the masculine arm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and who hasn't any rough edges
or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sharp points of view," suggested
the widow.</p>

<p>"Or opinions on the equality of the
sexes," added the bachelor.</p>

<p>"Or on politics."</p>

<p>"Or the higher life."</p>

<p>"Or on anything but the latest way
to curl her hair and make over a hat,"
finished the widow. "Isn't it funny,"
she added thoughtfully twisting a
French knot into the centre of the
sickly green rose, "how many men
idealize a fool?"</p>

<p>The bachelor started.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;-I beg your pardon," he stammered.</p>

<p>"All a woman has got to know in
order to wear a halo," went on the
widow, calmly fastening the French<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
knot with a jerk of her needle, "is
how to keep it on straight. All a man
demands of her is the negative virtues
and the knowledge of how not to
do things; how not to think, how not
to argue, how not to nag, how not to
theorize, how not to be athletic, how
not to spend money, how not to take
care of herself, how not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've got your ideas into a
French knot!" broke in the bachelor
desperately. "You're all tangled up
in the thread of your argument. It
isn't how not to do things but how to
do them that is important to a
woman. It isn't what she does but
how she does it that matters. She
may commit a highway murder or
low down burglary; and if she does
it in a ruffled skirt and a picture hat
any man will forgive her. Her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
morals may be as crooked and dark
as a lane at midnight; but if her manners
are smooth and gentle and guileless
and tender she can deceive the
cleverest man alive into believing her
a nun. It isn't what she says but how
she says it that counts. There are
some women who could read your
death warrant or repeat the multiplication
table in such a confiding
voice and with such a tender glance
that you would want to take them in
your arms and thank them for it. It
isn't what a woman wears but how
she wears it; it's not her beauty nor
her talents nor her frocks that make
her fascinating, but her ways, the
little earmarks of femininity that
God put on every creature born to
wear petticoats; and if she's got those
she may be a Lucretia Borgia or a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Bloody Mary at heart; she may be
brown or yellow or pale green; she
may be old or young, big or little,
stupid or clever, and still wear a
beautiful halo. The trouble," he
added, flicking the end of his cigar
thoughtfully, "is not with man's ideal
but with woman's deal. She holds
all the cards, but she plays them
badly. When a two-spot of flattery
would win her point, she deals a chap
the queen of arguments; when the
five of smiles would take the trick
for her, she plays the deuce of a pout.
When the ace of sympathy or the
ten of tact would put the whole game
of love into her hands, she thinks it is
time to be funny and flings a man the
joker."</p>

<p>The widow laid her work on the
table beside her, folded her hands in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
her lap and smiled at the bachelor
sweetly.</p>

<p>"That's just what I said," she remarked, gently.</p>

<p>"What you said!"</p>

<p>The widow nodded and rubbed
her nose reminiscently with the end
of her handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, "it isn't putting
powder on your nose or rouge on
your cheeks or perfume on your petticoats
or a broad 'A' on your accent
that shocks a man, but putting them
on inartistically. It isn't the things
you do but the things you overdo that
offend masculine taste. It's the 'over-done'
woman that a man hates&mdash;the
woman who is over-dressed or overly
made-up, or overly cordial or
overly flattering, or overly clever,
or overly good, or overly anything.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
He doesn't want to see how the
wheels go around at the toilet table
or in a woman's head or her heart;
and it's the subtle, illusive little thing
that he doesn't notice until he steps
on her and finds her looking up adoringly
at him under his nose that he
idealizes."</p>

<p>"And marries," added the bachelor
conclusively.</p>

<p>"And then forgets," sighed the
widow, "while he goes off to amuse
himself with the obvious person with
peroxide hair and a straight-front
figure. I don't know," she added tentatively,
"that it's much fun being an ideal woman."</p>

<p>"Who said you were?" demanded
the bachelor suddenly.</p>

<p>The widow started and turned
pink to her chin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;nobody&mdash;that is, several
people, Mr. Travers."</p>

<p>"Had you refused them?" asked
the bachelor thoughtfully.</p>

<p>The widow blushed a deeper pink
and bent over her pale green rose so
low that the bachelor could not see
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;that is&mdash;I don't see what
that has to do with it."</p>

<p>"It has everything to do with," replied
the bachelor positively.</p>

<p>"And you haven't told me yet,"
continued the widow, suddenly
changing the subject, "whom you
consider the ideal woman."</p>

<p>"Don't you know?" asked the
bachelor insinuatingly.</p>

<p>The widow shook her head without
lifting her eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, then, she is&mdash;but so many
of them have told you."</p>

<p>"You haven't," persisted the
widow.</p>

<p>The bachelor sighed and rose to
go.</p>

<p>"The ideal woman," he said, as he
slipped on his gloves, "is&mdash;the woman
you can't get. Is that the firelight
playing on your pompadour?" he
added, looking down upon the widow
through half-closed eyes. "Do you
know&mdash;for a moment&mdash;I thought it
was a halo."</p>

<h2>XII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">New Year's Irresolutions</span>.</h3>


<div class='cap'>"ISN'T it hard," said the widow,
glancing ruefully at the holly-wreathed
clock above the mantel-piece,
"to know where to begin reforming yourself?"</div>

<p>"Great heavens!" exclaimed the
bachelor, "you are not going to do
anything like that, are you?"</p>

<p>The widow pointed solemnly to
the hands of the clock, which indicated
11.30, and then to the calendar,
on which hung one fluttering leaf
marked December 31.</p>

<p>"It is time," she sighed, "to begin
our mental housecleaning, to sweep
out our collection of last year's follies,
and dust off our petty sins and
fling away our old vices and&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the trouble!" broke in the
bachelor. "It's so hard to know just
what to throw away and what to
keep. Making New Year's resolutions
is like doing the spring housecleaning
or clearing out a drawer full
of old letters and sentimental rubbish.
You know that there are lots
of things you ought to get rid of, and
that are just in the way, and that you
would be better off without, but the
minute you make up your mind to
part with anything, even a tiny, insignificant
vice, it suddenly becomes so
dear and attractive that you repent
and begin to take a new interest in
it. The only time I ever had to be
taken home in a cab was the day after
I promised to sign the pledge," and
the bachelor sighed reminiscently.</p>

<p>"And the only time I ever overdrew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
my bank account," declared the
widow, "was the day after I had resolved
to economize. I suppose," she
added pensively, "that the best way
to begin would be to pick out the
worst vice and discard that."</p>

<p>"And that will leave heaps of room
for the others and for a lot of new
little sins, besides, won't it?" agreed
the bachelor cheerfully. "Well," he
added philosophically, "I'll give up
murdering."</p>

<p>"What!" The widow started.</p>

<p>"Don't you want me to?" asked the
bachelor plaintively, rubbing his
bald spot. "Or perhaps I might resolve
not to commit highway robbery
any more, or to stop forging, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All of which is so easy!" broke in
the widow sarcastically.</p>

<p>"There'd be some glory and some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
reason in giving up a big vice,"
sighed the bachelor, "if a fellow had
one. But the trouble is that most of
us men haven't any big criminal
tendencies, merely a heap of little
follies and weaknesses that there isn't
any particular virtue in sacrificing
or any particular harm in keeping."</p>

<p>"And which you always do keep,
in spite of all your New Year's
vows," remarked the widow ironically.</p>

<p>"Huh!" The bachelor laughed
cynically. "It's our New Year's
vows that help us to keep 'em. The
very fact that a fellow has sworn to
forego anything, whether it's a habit
or a girl, makes it more attractive.
I've thrown away a whole box of
cigars with the finest intentions in the
world and then gotten up in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
middle of the night to fish the pieces
out of the waste basket. And that
midnight smoke was the sweetest I
ever had. It was sweeter than the
apples I stole when I was a kid and
than the kisses I stole when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you came here to dilate on the
joys of sin, Mr. Travers," began the
widow coldly.</p>

<p>"And," proceeded the bachelor,
"I've made up my mind to stop flirting
with a girl, because I found out
that she was beginning to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand," interrupted the
widow sympathetically.</p>

<p>"And by jove!" finished the bachelor,
"I had to restrain myself to keep
from going back and proposing to
her!"</p>

<p>"How lucky you did!" commented
the widow witheringly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I wouldn't have," explained
the bachelor ruefully, "if the girl had
restrained herself."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," repeated the
widow, "is was lucky&mdash;for the girl."</p>

<p>"Which girl?" asked the bachelor.
"The girl I broke off with or the
girl that came afterward?"</p>

<p>"I suppose," mused the widow,
ignoring the levity and leaning over
to arrange a bunch of violets at her
belt, "that is why it is so difficult for
a man to keep a promise or a vow&mdash;even
a marriage vow."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know." The bachelor
leaned back and regarded the
widow's coronet braid through the
smoke from his cigar. "It isn't the
marriage vows that are so difficult to
keep. It's the fool vows a man
makes before marriage and the fool<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
promises he makes afterward that he
stumbles over and falls down on. The
marriage vows are so big and vague
that you can get all around them
without actually breaking them, but
if they should interpolate concrete
questions into the service such as,
'Do you, William, promise not to
growl at the coffee'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or 'Do you, Mary, promise never
to put a daub of powder on your nose
again?'" broke in the widow.</p>

<p>"Nor to look twice at your pretty
stenographer," continued the bachelor.</p>

<p>"Nor to lie about your age, or your
foot or your waist measure."</p>

<p>"Nor to juggle with the truth
whenever you stay out after half past
ten."</p>

<p>"Nor to listen to things that&mdash;that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
anybody&mdash;except your husband&mdash;may
say to you in the conservatory&mdash;oh,
I see how it feels!" finished the
widow with a sympathetic little
shudder.</p>

<p>"And yet," reflected the bachelor,
"a woman is always exacting vows
and promises from the man she loves,
always putting up bars&mdash;for him to
jump over; when if she would only
leave him alone he would be perfectly
contented to stay within bounds
and graze in his own pasture. A
man hates being pinned down; but a
woman doesn't want anything around
that she can't pin down, from her
belt and her theories to her hat and
her husband."</p>

<p>"Well," protested the widow,
studying the toe of her slipper, "it
is a satisfaction to know you've got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
your husband fastened on straight by
his promises and held in place by his
vows and that he loves you enough
to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Usually," interrupted the bachelor,
"a man loves you in inverse
ratio to his protestations. The lover
who promises all things without reserve
is too often like the fellow who
doesn't question the hotel bill nor ask
the price of the wine, because he
doesn't intend to pay it anyway. The
fellow who is prodigal with vows and
promises and poetry is generally the
one to whom such things mean nothing
and, being of no value, can be
flung about generously to every girl
he meets. The firm with the biggest
front office is likely to be the one with
the smallest deposit in the safe. The
man who swears off loudest on New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Year's is usually the one they have to
carry home the morning after. And
the chap who promises a girl a life
of roses is the one who will let her
pick all the thorns off for herself."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," sighed the widow,
chewing the stem of a violet thoughtfully,
"the best way to cure a man
of a taste for anything, after all, is
to let him have too much of it, instead
of making him swear off. If you
want him to hate the smell of a pipe
insist on his smoking one all the time.
If you want him to sign the temperance
pledge serve him wine with
every course. If you want him to
hate a woman invite her to meet him
every time he calls, and tell him how
'suitable' she would be."</p>

<p>"And if you want him to love you,"
finished the bachelor, "don't ask him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
to swear it, but tell him that he really
ought not to. The best way to manage
a donkey&mdash;human or otherwise&mdash;is
to turn his head in the wrong direction,
and he'll back in the right one."</p>

<p>"Then," said the widow decisively,
"we ought to begin the New Year by
making some irresolutions."</p>

<p>"Some&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Vows that we won't stop doing
the things we ought not to do," explained
the widow.</p>

<p>"All right," agreed the bachelor
thoughtfully, "I'll make an irresolution
to go on making love to you as
much as I like."</p>

<p>"You mean as much as I like, Mr.
Travers," corrected the widow
severely.</p>

<p>"How much do you like?" asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the bachelor, leaning over to look
into the widow's eyes.</p>

<p>The widow kicked the corner of
the rug tentatively.</p>

<p>"I like&mdash;all but the proposing," she
said slowly. "You really ought to
stop that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm going to stop it&mdash;to-night,"
said the bachelor firmly.</p>

<p>The widow looked up in alarm.</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't have to commence
keeping your resolutions until to-morrow
morning," she said quickly.</p>

<p>"And you are going to stop refusing
me&mdash;to-night," continued the
bachelor firmly.</p>

<p>The widow studied the corner of
the rug with great concern.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 391px;">
<img src="images/illus-8.jpg" width="391" height="500" alt="&quot;OH don&#39;t. In a moment we&#39;ll be making promises.&quot; Page 177" title="" />
<div class='cap'><span class="caption">&quot;OH don&#39;t. In a moment we&#39;ll be making promises.&quot;</span></div><br /> <div class='pagref'><i>Page 177</i></div>
</div>

<p>"And," went on the bachelor, taking
something from his pocket and
toying with it thoughtfully, "you are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
going to put on this ring"&mdash;he leaned
over, caught the widow's hand and
slipped the glittering thing on her
third finger. "Now," he began, "you
are going to say that you will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The widow sprang up suddenly.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't, don't, don't!" she cried.
"In a moment we'll be making
promises."</p>

<p>"We don't need to," said the bachelor,
leaning back nonchalantly, "we
can begin by making&mdash;arrangements.
Would you prefer to live in town or
at Tuxedo? And do you think Europe
or Bermuda the best place for
the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bermuda, by all means," broke
in the widow, "and I wish you'd have
that hideous portico taken off your
town house, Billy, and&mdash;&mdash;" But the
rest of her words were smothered in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the bachelor's coat lapel&mdash;and something
else.</p>

<p>"Then you do mean to marry me,
after all?" cried the bachelor triumphantly.</p>

<p>The widow gasped for breath and
patted her hair anxiously.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I meant to marry you all the
time!" she cried, "But I never thought
you were really in earnest and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Methinks'," quoted the bachelor
happily, "'that neither of us did protest
too much.' We haven't made
any promises, you know."</p>

<p>"Not one," rejoined the widow
promptly, "as to my flirting."</p>

<p>"Nor as to my clubs."</p>

<p>"Nor as to my relatives."</p>

<p>"Nor my cigars."</p>

<p>"And we won't make any vows,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
cried the widow, "except marriage
vows."</p>

<p>"And New Year's irresolutions,"
added the bachelor.</p>

<p>"Listen," cried the widow softly,
with her fingers on her lips.</p>

<p>A peal of a thousand silver bells
rang out on the midnight air.</p>

<p>"The chimes!" exclaimed the
widow. "They're full of promises!"</p>

<p>"I thought it sounded like a wedding
bell," said the bachelor, disappointedly.</p>

<p>"Maybe," said the widow, "it was
only Love&mdash;ringing off."</p>
